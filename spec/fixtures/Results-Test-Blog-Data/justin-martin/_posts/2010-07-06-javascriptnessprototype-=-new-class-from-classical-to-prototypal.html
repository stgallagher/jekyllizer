title: JavaScriptness.prototype = new Class(); From Classical to Prototypal
tag:

<h2>
  JavaScript is a very misunderstood language. It has gotten a bad rap because most 
  people that use it don't look for its brighter side. Instead they will often look
  online for some code to copy paste, or they will hack something together using tiny
  snippets and in-lines to get a drop down menu.
</h2>
<p>
  It is also a very conflicted language. By nature, JavaScript is a Prototypal 
  language where nearly everything is an Object and there are no classes. It is also
  somewhat Functional since all the functions are First Class Functions. They are just
  more objects that can be passed into and returned from other functions.
</p>
<p>
  The issue is that many people try to use JavaScript like they would use Java or C++.
  They want a Classical language, where they strictly define all their types and then 
  create instances of those types. 
</p>
<p> 
  Even though JavaScript can be jammed, beaten, or even mutilated into Classical 
  structures (in fact the book <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> spent a 
  chapter on exactly that), this is betraying its nature and ignoring all the
  benefits that come with Prototypes.
</p>
<h3>The Classical Form</h3>
<p>
  Lets take a look at a basic Classical implementation of a Square using JavaScript:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-1.js%20"></script>
<p>
  You will notice that JavaScript even has a <code>new</code> key word in an attempt
  to match a Classical implementation. The <code>function Square()</code> defines a 
  class with a side attribute. It also has two instance methods, <code>area</code>
  and <code>perimeter</code>.
</p>
<p>
  We can then create mySquare in almost the same way we might do it in Java.  
  This is JavaScript though, and the <code>new</code> works differently in JS. 
  It creates a new, empty object and then calls the <code>Square()</code> function
  (or the constructor)  passing the empty object into <code>this</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The constructor then populates that object with the specified behavior before returning
  it.  This is particularly scary, because if you forget to put <code>new</code> in front
  of the constructor, <code> this </code> will refer to the Global Object, as will mySquare 
  (meaning any further changes made to mySquare would also be on the Square 'class'). 
</p>
<p>  
  This is why, if you want to use JS in the Classical way, you should always capitalize
  the first letter of a constructor.
</p>
<p>
  Ok, so we have our Square, but say we want to create a square that holds a X or an O. 
  Well, we would want to inherit the properties of our current Square &ldquo;Class&rdquo;
  and then add to them.  We might do something like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-2.js%20"></script>
<p>
  We create a new &ldquo;Class&rdquo; for the <code>ContainerSquare</code> which uses 
  the Square's constructor to define the <code>side</code> attribute, along with the 
  two instance methods. We then define our new <code>contents</code> attribute, along
  with an accessor method to go with it. 
</p>
<p>
  Line 6 sets up a Prototypal inheritance structure so that a <code>ContainerSquare</code>
  object will be linked to the proper prototype chain.
</p>
<p>
  The prototype chain is the hierarchy of objects that a method or attribute call will
  traverse until it finds what it is looking for. In other words, when I call 
  <code>myContainer.size()</code>, JavaScript will first check to see if the 
  <code>myContainer</code> object has that function.
</p>
<p>  
  If not, it will proceed to check the object's prototype, which is the 
  <code>ContainerSquare</code>. Since <code>ContainerSquare</code> doesn't have the function,
  next in line is ContainerSquare's prototype, which is just <code>Square</code>.
  <code>Square</code> does in fact have a <code>size()</code> function, and since javascript
  will use the first function it finds, it will use Square's <code>size()</code> function.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, by setting ContainerSquare's prototype to <code>Square</code>, we inherit any of the 
  attributes or methods of Square.
</p>
<p>
  Although this all works, and we have successfully mashed a Prototypal language into
  a Classical scheme, we should try this in the way JavaScript wants to be used.
</p>
<h3>The Prototypal Form</h3>
<p>
  We can start with the <code>Square</code>. There are few pretty simple ways to achieve
  the same functionality using regular objects and their prototypes, and we will look at 
  two of them. The first will create a square object that we can use. 
</p>
<p>
  Then if we need more squares, we can make a copy of that object using its prototype.
  The second will create a <code>squareMaker</code> function, which can then be used to
  pop out new squares.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-3.js"></script>
<p>
  Here, we already have a new and usable square at our disposal.  We don't need to call
  a constructor and define any types. We can just take an object and mold it into the
  form we want.
</p>
<p>
  Say we want another square though.  We can't just write something like 
  <code>var secondSquare = firstSquare;</code> because <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>
  passes objects by reference, and thus the second square would just point to the
  first square.
</p>
<p>
  What we can do, and this is a technique developed by Douglas Crockford, is make
  a copy of our object by calling a new constructor with a prototype that points to
  our object. This new constructor creates a new empty object and assigns the values
  of our old object to the new empty object.
</p>  
<p>
  You can do this yourself, or you can use Crockford's technique as follows:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-4.js"></script>
<p>
  You can see that we are actually defining an on the fly constructor <code>F</code>,
  using our object <code>o</code> to define F's prototype. Then we create
  a new object using that constructor.  This will give us a new copy of our
  object, with all its attributes and functions.  If we now called 
  <code>secondSquare.area();</code> we would get 36.
</p>
<p>
  If you wanted to then make a <code>ContainerSquare</code>, you could simply
  add a contents attribute to the second square, and then make copies of the
  <code>secondSquare</code> if you need more Containers. 
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that since <code>firstSquare</code> is the prototype of 
  <code>secondSquare</code>, if you were to add a contents attribute to 
  <code>firstSquare</code>, you would then have that attribute on <code>secondSquare;</code>
  however, adding attributes to the <code>secondSquare</code> does not place 
  them on the <code>firstSquare.</code>
</p>
<h3>Spawn More Protolords</h3>
<p>
  The other way to get squares would be to make a squareMaker function. 
  This function will return a new object with whatever attributes you define. I am also
  going to show you some closure so that the attributes are private, and only accessible 
  through accessor methods.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-5.js"></script>
<p>
  You will notice that the return value of the squareMaker is almost exactly like how we 
  defined our firstSquare object. We are just returning the definition of a square, and
  thats quite awesome. 
<p>
  Another thing you will notice is the bit of closure. We pass a value into the 
  <code>squareMaker</code>, but it isn't stored anywhere.  It is held in the scope of the
  <code>squareMaker</code> function, allowing those internal methods to use it, but
  hiding it from the outside (unlike the side attribute defined in the 
  <code>firstSquare</code>).
</p>  
<p>
  This sort of closure is another wicked awesome tool you can use in 
  <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.  In a way, this use of closure is like defining 
  private variables to a class.
</p>
<p>
  To get the Container functionality we create a <code>containerMaker</code> using
  the <code>squareMaker</code>, and some more closure, to make a new square object. 
  We then dynamically add a <code>getContents</code> method to provide access to 
  our private contents attribute.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049824.js?file=jmartin-20100706-6.js"></script>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  So we have now seen two ways to use some of the better parts of JavaScript to get 
  the same functionality that we could get using the Classical scheme.
</p>
<p>
  We can also see some advantages in using JS in its natural form like: getting some
  closure (which can be exceedingly powerful), very dynamic objects ready to change
  in anyway you can think of, quickly defined objects which can be used and multiplied, 
  and no need to predefine types. Pretty sweet right?
</p>
<p>
  I will admit one slight inefficiency with the two solutions I showed you (although
  there are ways around this). Using the <code>squareMaker</code>, or making copies
  of the objects will make full copies, including the function objects defined inside.
</p>
<p>
  If you use the Classical scheme I showed, you are defining functions on the 
  prototype rather than the object itself, thus there will only be one copy of
  the function.
</p>
<p>  
  You can, of course, do something similar in the <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> 
  scheme, but the optimization doesn't count for all that much in most cases 
  (unless you are doing mobile development where you want to save everything you can!).
</p>
<p>
  JavaScript isn't a Classical language, but instead a Prototypal language that is
  powerful enough to mimic a Classical language without breaking a sweat. There is
  much to be gained by recognizing this fact and changing your mindset to work with it. 
</p>
<p>
  Trying to fit a square into a circular hole will just get you stuck.  All languages
  are unique with a variety of their own advantages, and as good developers we should
  recognize these differences and reap all the benefits they have to offer.
