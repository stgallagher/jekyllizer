<h2>
  Most migrations do very little and run very quickly. Add a column or two; run in a second or two. Other
  migrations need to do much more, but we still want them to run just as quickly or nearly so. And, if
  they're going to take a little longer, we want to know why.

<h3>The Ace Ventura Migration</h3>
<p>
  In <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/">Ace Ventura</a>, as Ace is about to search a drained
  dolphin tank for clues of the crime, he says to those nearby, &ldquo;If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait
  longer.&rdquo; While good for a laugh, that's not good &ldquo;advice&rdquo; from a migration.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a migration that reminds me of Ace:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-1.rb"></script>
<p>
  A fairly typical migration, right? Add a column and give it a value for all existing records. But,
  look at the output from running it:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-2.rake"></script>
<p>
  12 minutes?!? That makes for a long feedback cycle, not to mention a long deploy. What's more,
  that 12 minutes silently passes between the <code>add_column</code> call and the end of the migration.
</p>
<p>
  Another developer who pulls down this migration and runs it is going to wonder what the hell is
  taking so long.
</p>
<h3>Be Talkative</h3>
<p>
  Whether this migration runs for 12 minutes or 12 seconds, we can be open about what it's doing by
  using 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html#method-c-say">
    <code>say</code>
  </a>
  or 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html#method-c-say_with_time">
    <code>say_with_time</code>.
  </a>
  Use <code>say</code> to display a message about what's being done in the block that you pass to it. 
  Use <code>say_with_time</code> to also display the elapsed time after the block executes. 
  We'll use <code>say_with_time</code>.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-3.rb%20"></script>
<p>
  Here's the output.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-4.rake"></script>
<p>
  That's much more informative, but it isn't any faster.
</p>
<h3>I Feel the Need...the Need for Speed</h3>
<p>
  Like Maverick and Goose from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/">Top Gun</a>,
  we feel the need for speed.
</p>
<p>
  <code>find_each</code> (Rails 2.3.x) finds records in batches of one thousand (which is configurable)
  and loads them into memory. Though there are no guarantees, hopefully garbage collection will run and
  free that memory. 
</p>
<p>
  Since we're working with several hundred thousand records in this migration, using
  <code>find_each</code> is a great way to avoid exhausting memory. We're not just finding records, though.
  We're also updating them...one at a time...with the same value. Oh.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any experience with SQL, you know that it operates on sets of records. ActiveRecord
  enables us to work that way when we need to with methods like 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-update_all">
    <code>update_all</code>.
  </a> 
  <code>update_all</code> constructs one SQL UPDATE statement and sends it to the database without
  loading the affected records.
</p>
<p>
  Update all records without having to find and load any of them first? Sounds perfect. Let's try it.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-5.rb"></script>
<p>
  And the result?
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-6.rake"></script>
<p>
  128x faster! I can wait 6s for feedback or as part of a deploy. We're not quite done, though.
</p>
<h3>Dotting the i's and Crossing the t's</h3>
<p>
  In our migration, we add a column and then use its ActiveRecord model to set its value for all existing
  records. To be sure we have immediate access to this new column via the model, we can call 
  <code>reset_column_information</code>. This method tells ActiveRecord to re-read the model's column 
  information from its backing database table. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1049961.js?file=cdemyanovich-20110506-7.rb"></script>
<p>
  I don't think I've ever seen a migration fail due to stale column information, but I wouldn't 
  chance it, since Murphy's Law will probably only be proven true during a production deploy.
</p>
<h3>(Code) Review</h3>
<p>
  Use 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html#method-c-say">
    <code>say</code>
  </a> 
  or 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html#method-c-say_with_time">
    <code>say_with_time</code>
  </a> 
  to be talkative about what migrations are doing when they do more than usual or, <i>by necessity</i>,
  take longer than a few seconds. Ensure migrations do their work quickly for rapid feedback in development
  and when deploying. 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-update_all">
    <code>update_all</code>
  </a> 
  and related methods let you work closer to SQL metal when you need their speed and efficiency of 
  working with large sets of data.
