title: Dependency Inversion Principle and iPhone
tag:
---


<h2>
  While working on the slides for our upcoming* talk on <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> 
  for iPhone I asked Eric Meyer why we need the Dependency Inversion Principle.  He 
  eagerly answered, &ldquo;Testing!&rdquo; which made me laugh because I wasn’t giving 
  him a trivia quiz, and I love Eric’s enthusiasm.  He’s right, but the answer is circular.  
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> is great because it gives us better 
  designs that correspond to the <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> 
  which enables <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>.  Ha!  I win, would 
  you like to buy my consulting services?  I have plenty of three letter acronyms where 
  those came from.
</h2>
<p>
  Fortunately this isn’t the case, as the 
  <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> existed well before 
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> was popularized, but recently there 
  was a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html">bit</a> 
  <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/06/on-open-letter-to-joel-spolsky-and-jeff-atwood">of</a> 
  a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001225.html">dust-up</a> over 
  the <abbr title="Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion">SOLID</abbr> 
  principles.  Many developers don’t understand why dependency inversion is important, 
  so let’s demonstrate the usefulness in the Objective-C language on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
  The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) reads as follows:
</p>

<p>
  <em>A. High level modules should not depend upon low level modules.  Both should 
  depend upon abstractions.</em>
  <br>
  <em>B. Abstractions should not depend upon details.  Details should depend upon 
  abstractions.</em>
</p>
<p>
  So your code should depend on interfaces not on concrete classes, but why?  Let’s 
  look at a useful example in the Objective-C built in classes.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-1.m"></script>
<p>
  Do you see the <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> at work?  
  It’s subtle here, but look at the method stringWithFormat, which takes a format 
  string and then a list of parameters to fill in the format specifiers.  The format 
  specifier here is &ldquo;%@&rdquo; which takes any Objective-C object and calls 
  descriptionWithLocale on it, or description otherwise.  The object that is passed 
  in here could be anything because all the stringWithFormat method cares about is 
  that the object provides at least one of the two methods above.  It’s depending 
  on the interface, and not the concrete class.  Let’s imagine a world where this 
  didn’t exist, and the NSString method could only be composed of other strings.  
  Suddenly you’d have something like:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-2.m"></script>
<p>
  That’s not bad at all is it?  Well what if there are different objects.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-3.m"></script>
<p>
  Are you starting to see the problem?  Suddenly I can’t use this method without being
  cognizant of the specifics of the object I passed in.  The minute one of these 
  interfaces changes I have to change my code.  I stole this method from some real 
  code, so let’s look at it with some context.  Once upon a time I was writing a mock 
  object for an iPhone application.  Now iPhone doesn’t have a good mock object 
  framework, at least that I’m aware of, so I was rolling my own mock.  The mock 
  logged calls to it which I then queried.  To construct the string I used this 
  method:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-4.m"></script>
<p>
  Don’t sweat the details right now, they’re not important.  Instead look at how you 
  can see the <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> succeeding and 
  failing in the same code here.  The first parameter to createStringFrom is a cell 
  object, but it’s of type id, so it could really be anything.  That’s good because 
  I wasn’t sure when I wrote this mock what type the cell would be and I’d generally 
  prefer that my mock object not have to know the details.  In fact the cell did 
  change type several times which is why insulating yourself from change is so 
  important.  There’s an assumption by many developers that you should only worry 
  about the things you’ll be changing in the future, but the best gauge of future 
  changes is present changes, and if you’re changing a module frequently during 
  development as you get it right you’ve found a likely change point.  Even if you 
  haven’t, you’ll make your life simpler in the present by insulating yourself from 
  that change, speeding up your development cycles.  I digress.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of this method isn’t so lucky.  You see CGPoint and CGRect are C structures, 
  and I am left to write these as floats in the string (%f).  If I was to change the 
  parameter types frequently I would probably introduce some way to insulate myself 
  from that change as well, possibly by wrapping them in objects.  Since those 
  parameters have not changed I haven’t done that, although I’m thinking about it.

  Our current apprentice Colin has given a first-hand account of refactoring to 
  <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> 
  <a href="http://softwareapprenticeship.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/week-2-thursday/">here</a> 
  as well.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How do I do it?</strong>

  Eric and I are working on a program to run 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_game_of_life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.  
  On the iPhone screen you see Rounded Rect Buttons that change color based on whether 
  a cell is alive or dead.  The problem is that we don’t really want to drag and drop 
  300+ tiny buttons on the screen with interface builder.  Instead we want to create 
  them programatically, when the GameOfLifeViewController is loaded.  Again I don’t 
  want to overload you with extraneous details, so just take my word for it that there 
  is a GameOfLifeViewController, and it needs to generate buttons.  Here’s what my 
  first pass at a test looked like in rough pseudocode:
</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-5.m"></script>
<p>
  There’s a lot wrong with this test.  The most obvious is the hard coded 15.  What 
  happens when we want to change the number of rows and columns?  Now we have to 
  change code in multiple places.  Naturally we did in fact change this, so I would 
  have paid for this decision quickly if I hadn’t already refactored it away.  The 
  second is that there’s going to be more than one test for creation, each of which 
  will have to perform the same 15x15 loop.  The annoyance of constantly changing this 
  will reveal the root the problem, the GameOfLifeViewController should really only 
  be in charge of GameOfLifeView and really doesn’t need to know the details of the 
  creation of its subviews.  It’s violating the Single Responsibility Principle.  We 
  can fix that with a factory object, and will do so, but that will violate the 
  Dependency Inversion Principle.  So we’ve got one 
  <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> violation, an 
  <abbr title="Single Responsibility Principle">SRP</abbr> violation, and a potential 
  second <abbr title="Dependency Inversion Principle">DIP</abbr> violation, all 
  demonstrated in 6 lines of test code.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately we’re going to introduce some interfaces to clean that up.  The first 
  is an interface to the board object.  Why the board?  Well the board should know 
  the number of rows and columns it has, and if we can inject a fake version of the 
  board we can actually set those to be 1 and 1.  That’s will make our test focus on 
  what we are truly concerned about.  The second thing we’re going to do is introduce 
  the Abstract Factory pattern to create our button views.  It’s a bit of a heavyweight 
  solution but its going to pay off by cleaning up our client code dramatically.  We’ll 
  have a View Controller concerned with controlling the view, and a creation factory 
  concerned with creation, as well as a board that keeps track of rows.  Let’s take a 
  look at the test now, again in rough pseudocode.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-6.m"></script>
<p>
  So what’s going on here?  In the setup we load up the board with a fake board, one 
  that returns 1 for its rows and columns, and we load up its buttonControllerFactory 
  with a fake buttonController Factory.  In our test we call the viewDidLoad method, 
  which is called on controllers after their view is loaded.  Duh.  That’s the method 
  where we use the buttonControllerFactory.  Then we call a method on the mock factory 
  calledWith: that takes the parameters I expected the creation factory to receive.  
  Finally we check that it was called with the assertion.  So far I’ve only been 
  showing test code, because I wanted to demonstrate just how much cleaner our tests 
  have become.  Now there’s no loop, no hard coded constants, and no testing the 
  internals of the creation factory in the view controller.  That isn’t to say we 
  don’t test the creation, we just do that in a different test case, the one that 
  corresponds to the ConcreteButtonFactory class.  As a rule if our test code is 
  cleaner, our implemenation code is cleaner, and that’s the case here as well.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s now look at the real class, and how to enable Dependency Inversion on it.  We 
  have to start with Objective-C protocols.  Protocols are very similar to Java 
  interfaces, and just as useful, but are strangely underrepresented in XCode.  As 
  best I can tell** just create an NSObject subclass and remove the .m file and any 
  imports from the .h.  Here’s the protocol from the unfortunately named 
  ButtonControllerFactoryProtocol.h:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-7.m"></script>
<p>
  As you can see the interface only defines one message, createButtonControllerForCell.  
  It returns the ButtonController object, although it could return an object conforming 
  to a protocol.  Indeed one could argue it should, as that would streamline my mock 
  object.  Hmmm… I see a refactoring in my future.  Now let’s look at the class 
  definition for the ConcreteButtonControllerFactory, which is the object that is 
  actually used when the real app is running.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057173.js?file=esmith-20090416-8.m"></script>
<p>
  Not much here is there.  The important part to look at is 
  NSObject<buttoncontrollerfactoryprotocol>.  ConcreteButtonControllerFactory inherits 
  from NSObject, as all Cocoa objects do, and conforms to the 
  ButtonControllerFactoryProtocol.  Like a Java interface this is a contract to later 
  implement createButtonControllerForCell in my implementation file and that’s exactly 
  what I’ve done.</buttoncontrollerfactoryprotocol>
</p>

<p>
  This isn’t an article on UIKit so I’m not going to get into the details of creating 
  the button.  You can see again that I’ve ignored the DIP for creating the UIButton 
  and the ButtonController.  Since this is a factory I’m okay with this violation.  I 
  could have created abstract factories for the UIButton and ButtonController and 
  passed them in here but I don’t believe I’d gain any benefit from that implementation.  
  That’s verified by my testing, as writing tests for the creation of these objects was 
  hard before I introduced this factory but isn’t any longer.  If it becomes difficult 
  then I’ll consider making the change to two factories.  Now we need to inject the 
  concrete dependency.  In a Java project you could do this in a main method or with a 
  <abbr title="Dependency Injection">DI</abbr> framework like Spring.  We’re going to 
  be using my favorite <abbr title="Dependency Injection">DI</abbr> framework of all 
  time: Interface Builder!<em>*</em>
</p>
<p>
  It’s a common misconception that <abbr title="Interface Builder">IB</abbr> is just 
  a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> builder.  What’s great about 
  it is that it doesn’t just generate a bunch of code, but instead &ldquo;freeze dries&rdquo; 
  real objects to be instantiated when the program loads the 
  <abbr title="NeXT Interface Builder">NIB</abbr> file.  Furthermore while the most 
  common Outlets are <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements there’s no 
  reason other objects can’t be used.  Let’s take a look at my 
  <abbr title="NeXT Interface Builder">NIB</abbr> document window for the 
  GameOfLifeViewController:
</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/paytonrules/bk2rf/gameoflifeviewcontroller.xib-3"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090406-1tcgehw25t5r4iaria1wgurnrb.preview.jpg" alt="GameOfLifeViewController.xib-3"></a><br><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>’s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>
<p>
  As you can see I’ve got objects for the Game, ConcreteButtonControllerFactory, and 
  the Board.  That’s because all three of the objects are injected at runtime, while 
  the code depends on protocols.  To add your own objects to a 
  <abbr title="NeXT Interface Builder">NIB</abbr> file simply by selecting it from 
  the Library:
</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/paytonrules/bk2re/activity-monitor"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090406-mh3fde4mes6ftsq3f93ss8xau.preview.jpg" alt="Activity Monitor"></a><br><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>’s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>
<p>
  It’s inspector window will have a class drop down, so set this object’s object to 
  your class.  Finally you need to connect the outlets to actual outlets in your code.  
  Let’s look at the Outlets tab in <abbr title="Interface Builder">IB</abbr> for my 
  controller (the File’s Owner): 
</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/paytonrules/bk2rj/game-of-life-view-controller-identity"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090406-mhby6u9pu812hwef8iatnf1i4h.preview.jpg" alt="Game Of Life View Controller Identity"></a><br><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>’s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>
<p>
  Notice how the controller still thinks of them all as NSObject?  So if I change the 
  objects it doesn’t care, as long as I conform to the interface? Finally let’s take 
  a peek at the controller interface file:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057187.js?file=esmith-20090416-10.m"></script>
<p>
  See any dependencies on the actual objects?  Nope - just protocols.  There are 
  properties for the objects so that I can inject the dependencies through the tests, 
  all of which pass in fake versions as various times depending on how it suits the 
  test.  It may be unhealthy - but I find this incredibly cool.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What I love about Interface Builder is setting this up is extremely simple.  Writing 
  tests for the controller that is based on these dependencies is also extremely simple, 
  far simpler than just depending on the concrete objects.  It’s funny how developers 
  often complain about the time wasted writing tests or &ldquo;over-engineering&rdquo; 
  in this way, but once I broke these dependencies I got things done a lot faster.  
  I’m writing working code without loading the actual simulator.  I write my tests 
  first, making progress, and when I’m done for the session I run the app once or 
  twice just to verify I haven’t done anything like forgotten to inject the dependency.  
  Compare that to running the simulator constantly, each time hoping your code is 
  functional.  Who’s wasting their time now?
