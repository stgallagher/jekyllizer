title: Want clean code? Stop using the editor.
tag:

<p>
	Recently I was adding some accessors to a ruby class on the fly, and I kept getting confused by 
	this block:
</p>
<!-- eval <<-eof def> -->
<p>
	The code isn’t particularly complicated, just creating a quick accessor to get at the underlying 
	hash. Yet I had a couple bugs simply because without the editor to give me hints, the code was 
	that much harder to follow. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as I am forced to write 
	extremely clean code just to keep from confusing myself. Opening up the String class cleans this 
	up a bit, and removes duplication:
</p>
<!-- eval <<-eof def> -->
<p>
	There much better. So the next time you think your code isn’t as clear as it could be, or maybe 
	if you think it’s perfect, try reading it without any syntax highlighting. If you can still follow 
	it quickly and easily, then maybe it doesn’t entirely suck.
