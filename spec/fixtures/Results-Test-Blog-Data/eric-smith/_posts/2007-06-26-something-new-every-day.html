	Last December I went to to StarEast in Orlando because my fiancee is a tester and I well, 
	I like sun. While there I picked up the book 
	<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer">
	Practices of an Agile Developer</a> and was particularly struck by the practice to keep a 
	“Solutions Log.” The way a solutions log works is simple. Every time you find a solution 
	to a problem you write it down, and later when you are confronted by a similar problem you 
	have a reference. “Gee Whiz what a great idea!” I thought to myself, because I think to 
	myself like Beaver Cleaver, “this way when Jim asks me about that bug I solved two weeks ago, 
	I’ll know exactly what to tell him, instead of saying “uhhh, err, yeah I sorta kinda 
	remember…” It really was an amazing revelation, seeing as how I hadn’t met Jim yet.

	Then I got home and subscribed to 
	<a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d2754a12-8f7c-4406-a4ad-92dca4c6942d">
	Venkat’s blog</a> where he recommended <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> for keeping 
	this list. If you’re unfamiliar with TiddlyWiki it’s an extremely cool browser-based personal 
	note-taking tool that works entirely via JavaScript and CSS. You fire up your personal version of 
	the html file, double click, and viola! there you have a note saved into the very document. Best 
	of all it’s searchable even via regular expressions and plain text. With this tool I was gonna be 
	a solution mastermind! People will ask me for that bug I fixed 14 years ago and I’ll be right there 
	with my genius hat on and everything. You do have a genius hat don’t you?
</p>
<p>
	How did it work out? Roughly 18 months later I have a whopping… 16 solutions, most of them written 
	in the first week. You know what I learned from this? I suck at keeping a solutions list. The thing 
	is I have no idea something is a solution to a recurring problem, until I come upon it a second time! 
	What I need is a way to psychically determine what the solutions I’m going to need in the future are, 
	and identify them. Um….

	I’ve decided on a different option, which I think fits in well with the craftsmanship approach of 
	perpetual learning. Since joining 8th Light I’ve been lucky enough to learn enormous amounts in a 
	short amount of time, with more on the way, but of course none of this is in my solutions list. So 
	instead of catching the realization that something is a solution, I’m going to write it all down. 
	I’ve created a new list, and instead of calling it a Solutions List, it’s my LearnANewThingEveryDay 
	list. Every day I’m obligated to write a new note with something I’d learned that day. If a day goes 
	by and I haven’t learned something, I have to go learn something. I’ll read a book, find a great 
	blog posting, try out a coding exercise, whatever. For example today I have written down some things 
	I didn’t know about routing in rails. Mundane stuff that people more experienced with routing already 
	new such as the :path_prefix parameter. What would be an otherwise fruitless day debugging now has a 
	few little things I’ve learned from it. Will I ever search for that item? I don’t know - but the 
	point is I can, so when Jim asks me how to get eric/is/the/coolest/blogger in front of all his links, 
	I won’t stand there scratching my head.
