<p>
	I’m a bit overdue on blogging, so in lieu of the normally brilliant and insightful commentary 
	on the state of…er something… I usually put here I thought I’d share something that we at 8th 
	Light have started doing.
</p>
<p>
	Push-ups.
</p>
<p>
	Every hour. Yes I realize it’s nuts, but look at a typical day for me. Wake up too late. Rush 
	to get ready. Get distracted by something on the computer (today it was RubyCocoa). Realize 
	that I won’t make it to the gym in time to lift weights. Work too late. Come home, eat, maybe 
	help my future step-children with their homework. Suddenly it’s 10, and I haven’t worked out.
</p>
<p>
	Aha - but I did 150 push-ups today. I think - I don’t actually count. Here’s how the 
	<i>8th Light Fitness Plan</i> (published Spring 2008) works. Every hour, on the hour, do 
	push-ups. We started at 10 every hour and that was pretty hard once upon a time, now we’re 
	up to 25. Well most of us. Today I saw two of the guys in another part of the building doing 
	them, and I figure that if it caught on amongst 8th Light it can catch on elsewhere. After 
	all we’re not that weird. Are we?
