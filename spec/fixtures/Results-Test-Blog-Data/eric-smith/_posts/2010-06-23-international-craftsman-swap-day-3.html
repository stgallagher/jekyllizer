Got Ruby?
-->

<p>
  After attending tonights got:ruby I became obsessed with and started installing rvm. 
  It worked swimmingly, and I’m looking forward to getting my development machine off 
  of the embarrassingly low version of Ruby and experimenting on the latest versions 
  without (unintentionally) screwing up my production environment. Indeed after this 
  week I’ve got a lot to google, lookup, and research. I’ve decided I have got to get 
  good at JQuery - probably using it on a small Rails 3 project in the near future - and 
  learned that Jasmine has it all over ScrewUnit. This may mess up my Haskell plans - 
  not that I’ve ever messed that up before. After that we played a lot of ping-pong, 
  then I decided to clean up my hard drive, because it was really time. Then I realized 
  if I’m gonna do this project as Rails3, I better make sure I can deploy it on dreamhost 
  with bundler.
</p>  

<p>
  If this sounds like procrastinating it’s cause it is. I also checked email, read Anders’ 
  blog on the elabs.se site, and watched some of Germany beating Ghana. None of this is 
  writing the blog post and that’s because today’s blog post is going to be hard. Let’s 
  get this out of the way first. Today was another great day at ELabs. With my Jet Lag 
  finally kicked I really was able to contribute, using a couple ideas we’ve had before 
  on 8th Light projects to get some cool work done on the project I’ve been working on this 
  week. I even wrestled for the keyboard a bit (although they have two keyboards - so it was 
  lonely, I wrestled with Pixie) then we topped it all off a cool Ruby user group meeting. 
  The meeting was last minute, so they had lightning talks where CJ talked about Bundler and 
  rvm, Jonas talked about a Javascript testing plugin he’s working on, we puzzled over a 
  problem one of the other developers was having and even looked at Omni Graffle. Now that 
  I’m awake the ELabs guys had to suffer my jokes like the 8th Light guys do all the time. 
  Now they know why they sent me out of the country.
</p>

<p>
  What’s been really nagging at me has to do with the way that the ELabs boys work. See 
  they are what Brian Marick would call “classicist” TDDers - they essentially never use 
  mocks. I on the other hand generally mock out a lot. What Jonas said to me was, and I’m 
  going from memory here, “I’d rather the tests run slow than be right.” Of course taken as 
  stated, this is a truism. Nobody is voting for slow tests, although I might argue that the 
  tests that verify correctness are often different than unit tests, and that unit tests are 
  verifying a different thing. Aside from speed mocks provide value in designing apis by 
  letting you design it with a client using it, before the object itself exists, and in thinking 
  of systems as objects passing around messages you can really focus on their interactions 
  instead of the implementation details. Mocks lead to a cleaner design all told….except….
</p>

<p>
  Except I usually stub out things for speed. Objects I’m stubbing are webservices, database 
  objects, file access, etc. And in the best cases the benefit I get is speed, and in the worst 
  cases I get a tangled mess of mocks where my code and tests are coupled, but nothing necessarily 
  works. I’ve completely traded speed for correctness. Why is that? Why am I not getting all 
  the purported benefits of mocking.
</p>

<p>
  In a related note on the way here I started reading “growing object oriented software, guided 
  by tests” by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. In a throw away comment they say, “Never mock out 
  third party API’s, write thin classes that wrap those with integration tests, and mock out 
  your objects interaction with those classes.” Now maybe you think you haven’t done this, but 
  let me give you some typical examples of mocks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IO.stub!(:read).and_return(mock_file)</li>
  <li>ActiveRecord.should_receive(:find).with(1)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Well look at that - those are two third party API’s aren’t they? And they are often mocked 
  out everywhere! Trading speed for correctness again. “Okay fancy boy”, you’re saying - and 
  really why are you calling me that, “Then we shouldn’t use mocks. Problem solved.” Not so fast. 
  Have you ever had the problem where you are testing that an object gets saved and you do this:
</p>  

<p>
  object.should_receive(:update_attributes).with({:my => value})
</p>  

<p>
  but then you think, “Gosh I really don’t care how they save the values, I just care that it 
  gets saved.” Right now you have to call update_attributes to make this pass, but you could call 
  update_attribute, or set the object and save!, or hell use SQL although you shouldn’t. This makes 
  for a crappy test - one you’re likely to break then fix later instead of changing in the deliberate 
  process of TDD. What if instead you did this:
</p>

<p>
  object.should_receive(:update_my_value_to).with(value)
</p>  

<p>
  Of course the other things are still true - assuming it’s an active record object, but maybe 
  it’s not. Maybe it’s a wrapper around it, or maybe it’s datamapper object, I don’t really don’t 
  care. I’ve gone ahead and mocked this call because that’s the call I really want to see - and 
  somewhere else I’ve test driven that call against the database. Now let’s imagine you’ve got 
  more complicated scenarios. Ever done this?
</p>

<p>
  object.should_receive(:get_this).and_return(object2)
  <br>
  object2.should_receive(:is_true?).and_return(false)
</p>

<p>
  This is a simple example - but I’m sure you’ve seen worse. The problem is again that you really 
  need one method, maybe two, but you probably figured out in your head the algorithm beforehand, 
  then test drove it. Maybe you know if object2 was true you needed to set unrelated object3’s flag 
  - so you started writing those tests. Let’s look at that rule again though - don’t mock a third 
  party API. Well what defines a third party API? Is it a third party if another company wrote it? 
  How about the same company - but on a different project? Or the same project but a long time ago? 
  Or YOU six weeks ago and you forgot it. Isn’t it a third party API again? What’s the difference? 
  Should you then mock out objectnew - and test drive it with real objects? Because it’s pretty 
  clear the API you want doesn’t exist yet, and that’s the crux of my long wrambling argument that 
  I’ll probably better express and codify when it’s not late and I’m not tired:
</p>

<h3>Stop mocking the API you already have - mock the API you need</h3>

<p>
  And then if by chance it matches the API you already have - by all means just substitute the 
  real object in. But write the implementation with mocks first - without using any real API unless 
  it matches coincidentally. Pretend the object doesn’t exist yet, and then mock. And maybe then 
  you’ll get what you’re looking for.
</p>  

<p>
  Eh - or maybe I should go write some Javascript.
