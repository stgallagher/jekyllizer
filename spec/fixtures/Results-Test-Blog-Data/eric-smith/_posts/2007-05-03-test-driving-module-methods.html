title: Test Driving Module Methods

<p>
	Recently I had the pleasure and frustration of working the net-sftp gem for Ruby. Pleasure 
	because it’s a well written library, with an easy to use syntax that looks something like 
	this:
</p>
<!-- 
Net::SFTP.start( 'localhost', :registry_options => { :logs => { :levels => { "sftp.*" => :debug } } }) do |sftp|
  sftp.put_file "test.data", "temp/blah.data"
  puts "getting remote file to local location..."
  sftp.get_file "temp/blah.data", "new.data"
end 
-->
<p>
	The above is just a shortened version from one of the examples in the GEM itself. It’s simple 
	to use and easy to read. Having written similar code in C++, for Windows no less, I can really 
	appreciate how quickly this can get an FTP application off the ground. The frustration came 
	when I went to test drive this guy. Net::SFTP.start is a module method, not a class member. I 
	can’t stub it in the traditional way using the RSpec stub! command or use should_receive. On 
	top of that it passes back a block, which needs to be tested to make sure it’s being called 
	correctly. After a few shots at mocking it out Paul and I test drove it with an actual FTP 
	server. In the short term that was necessary anyway, as a hazard of frequent mocking can be 
	that you are only testing how well you read the API. You see that when the tests pass and the 
	first shot at actually running the code blows up. In the long term the customer asked for a 
	few new small features, changing directories and what not, and I really want to get this under 
	long-term test to do that. So how do we do it?
</p>
<p>
	Well we could stop using the .start command entirely. We could pass in a mock Net::SFTP 
	object and test it, making sure to close it manually. Unfortunately that eliminates the clean 
	code we see above, and if possible I’d like to keep it. The solution is to intercept the start 
	method.
</p>
<p>
	The first thing I do is 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patch</a> the code like so:
</p>
<!-- 
module Net ; module SFTP
  def start( *args, &block )
  end
  module_function :start
end ; end 
context "My Context" do 
-->
<p>
	I’ve put it before the context, to make sure it’s redefined before the object I’m testing 
	is created. Next we need to expose our mock objects in the context to the monkey patch. 
	This isn’t done with traditional writers and readers, because that would require finding 
	the specific specification running for each time through the monkey patched start. Instead 
	we make our mocks class members in the setup method, and create a class method in the context 
	to retrieve the variables. The class method looks like this:
</p>
<!-- def Spec.get_mock_ftp_objects
  return @@mock_starter, @@mock_session
end -->
<p>
	This reveals a bit of the underworkings of RSpec. Each block in the context block is turned into 
	a class method using class_eval, as part of the Spec object. Making the method static allowed 
	this new monkey patched method:
</p>
<!-- module Net
  module SFTP
    def start( *args, &block )
      @mock_starter, @mock_session = Spec.get_mock_ftp_objects
      @mock_starter.start args[0], args[1], args[2]
      yield @mock_session
    end
    module_function :start
  end
end -->
<p>
	The code gets the two mock objects via our new method. Isn’t it grand how Ruby lets you return 
	multiple objects? The call to start allows me to make sure that the arguments passed to the real 
	start are correct. The real interesting call is the yield. By yielding the mock back to the 
	object it will replace the sftp in the original code. Now I can test it! In fact I’ve already 
	realized a bug in my code (in stopping) just by the process of doing this. I love it when a plan 
	comes together. The final code example is here, I ended up extracting out a new class, so the 
	names have changed. This one tests both the starting object and the block yielded:
</p>
<!-- require 'net/sftp'
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/ftp_client")

module Net
  module SFTP
    def start( *args, &block )
      @mock_starter, @mock_session = Spec.get_mock_ftp_objects
      @mock_starter.start args[0], args[1], args[2]
      yield @mock_session
    end
    module_function :start
  end
end

context "FTP Client" do  
  setup do
    @client = FtpClient.new("test_server", "user", "password", "directory")
    @@mock_starter = mock('mock_starter')
    @@mock_session = mock('mock_session')
    @@mock_session.stub!(:opendir)
    @@mock_session.stub!(:close_handle)
  end

  specify "makes ftp connection, to proper place" do
    @@mock_starter.should_receive(:start).with("test_server", "user", "password")
    @client.read_from_server
  end

  specify "changes to ftp_directory, better close that handle" do
    @@mock_starter.should_receive(:start).with("test_server", "user", "password")
    @@mock_session.should_receive(:opendir).with("directory").and_return("fake handle")
    @@mock_session.should_receive(:close_handle).with("fake handle")
    @client.read_from_server
  end

  def Spec.get_mock_ftp_objects
    return @@mock_starter, @@mock_session
  end
end -->
<p>
	Maybe this isn’t the best way to do this, but I like it. I’m looking forward to comments.
