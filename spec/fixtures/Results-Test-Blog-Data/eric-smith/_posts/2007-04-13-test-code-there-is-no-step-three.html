<p>
	Occasionally even great developers fall into bad habits, and the rest of us do it more 
	than occasionally. This is especially true when under deadline and suddenly everything 
	you’ve ever learned is thrown out the window in a desperate effort to get something to 
	finish. I’ll share a story from a recent project to demonstrate just how much trouble 
	rushing can get you into, and why we shouldn’t chuck our good habits at the first sign 
	of adversity.
</p>
<p>
	The story was relatively simple. Multiple XML documents needed to be generated based on 
	information from another application in the system. My pair and I sat down and wrote our 
	first test, which looked a little something like this:
</p>
<!-- 
specify valid data should generate valid document do
  data.valid  = true

  doc = doc_generator.generate(data)
  doc.valid?.should eql(true)
  doc.header.should eql(â€œValid Headerâ€)
  doc.text.should eql(â€œValid Textâ€)
  doc.footer.should eql(â€œFooterâ€)
end 
-->
<p>
	So then we wrote a little code:
</p>
<!-- 
def generate(data)
  if data.valid
    doc = Document.new
    doc.header = â€œValid Headerâ€
    doc.text = â€œValid Textâ€
    doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
  end
end 
-->
<p>
	Okay we’ve got a passing test, with the 
	<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork">simplest thing 
	that could possibly work.. Great. Now let’s do the next one. Looking at the acceptance test 
	we need to generate a different document when the data is notifying us of inaccessible data. 
	Unfortunately there isn’t a flag for that, so we’ll have to figure it out from a combination 
	of booleans. We write another test, we get it to pass with this code:
</p>
<!-- def generate(data)
  if data.valid
    doc.header = â€œValid Headerâ€
    doc.text = â€œValid Textâ€
    doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
  elsif data.invalid and data.accessible
    doc.header = â€œDifferent Headerâ€
    doc.text = â€œDifferent Valid Textâ€
    doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
  end
end -->
<p>
	That’s getting pretty ugly, but hey all the tests pass and we’re under deadline. We could 
	replace the boolean checks with a query, but we’ve really got to finish and can’t be bothered 
	with that kind of change. It would take almost a minute! Of course the big problem isn’t this 
	code, it’s that we have quite a few more acceptance tests to go. Eventually this code looked 
	something like this:
</p>
<!-- 
def generate(data)
  if data.valid
    doc.header = â€œValid Headerâ€
    doc.text = â€œValid Textâ€
    doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
  elsif data.invalid and data.accessible
    doc.header = â€œDifferent Headerâ€
    doc.text = â€œDifferent Valid Textâ€
    doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
  elsif data.reset and not data.invalid
    if data.new
      doc.header = â€œYet more Different Headersâ€
      doc.text = â€œValid Textâ€
      doc.footer = â€œNew Footerâ€
    else
      doc.header = â€œAnother Different Headerâ€
      doc.text = â€œRandom Textâ€
      doc.footer = â€œa completely different Footerâ€
    end
  else
    doc.header = â€œYet more Different Headersâ€
    doc.text = â€œOh for crying out loud.â€
    doc.footer = â€œGood god another Footerâ€  
  end
end 
-->
<p>
	What do all those boolean combinations check for? Heck I don’t know. On top of that we’ve got 
	several messages that are sent by this class that don’t use the data passed in, which look like 
	this:
</p>
<!-- def send_error(message)
  doc.header = â€œError Headerâ€
  doc.text = message
  doc.footer = â€œFooterâ€
end -->
<p>
	Clearly we had a problem, and my pair and I knew it the entire time, yet each time the refactor 
	step in TDD arrived we would grin and bear it, with that deadline looming. Each time the step 
	would take longer and longer, as the code became more complex, but we wouldn’t change because 
	of the immediate benefit. It’s always quicker to just change the one piece of code, right?
</p>
<p>
	Obviously the answer is no, it isn’t. My pair and I demoed our code, made the customer happy and 
	than frantically began rewriting the code. After about two more days of broken tests we had a 
	reasonably clean and elegant solution, and I didn’t have to hide the code from Micah anymore. How 
	long did the first draft take? Oh, about two days all told. So we laugh and realize we could have 
	made our deadline even if we had done the job right the first time, but even that isn’t true. 
	Remember the code became more and more complex as we worked through the story, and began to resemble 
	legacy code. Each new document required us to figure out each boolean check, and usually led to us 
	breaking old tests as the fragile code changed. I firmly believe that if we hadn’t continues using 
	the blunt tools of conditional code and implemented the object-oriented solution we later refactored 
	to we would have actually been done more quickly. Furthermore while cleaning up that ugly code I 
	wasn’t providing business value to the customer, thereby hurting the following iteration. A few days 
	later I needed to add a new document to the system. What had previously taken a half-hour or so for 
	each case took seconds. Imagine if we had done that the first time. The moral of the story clear. 
	<a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2007/01/29/clean-as-you-code">CleanAsYouCode</a>, and 
	don’t let deadline pressure cause you to abandon your own principles. In the long run and short 
	run you’ll improve your codebase, make your customer happy, and probably enjoy your job more too.
