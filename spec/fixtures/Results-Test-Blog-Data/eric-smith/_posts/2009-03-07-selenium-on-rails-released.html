title: Selenium on Rails Released
tag:

<h2>
  Quick announcement, Selenium on Rails has been released, now supporting Rails 2.2 and 
  with the latest Selenium Core. Numerous bug fixes are in this release as well, thanks 
  to commiters Marcos Tapajós, Nando Vieria, and Gordon McCreight.
</h2>
<p>
  To update to the latest version install the plugin from 
  http://svn.openqa.org/svn/selenium-on-rails/stable/selenium-on-rails. This release is 
  once again not compatible with previous versions of Rails, so check the website to 
  install new revisions.
</p>
<p>
  I also want to add a new patch policy. To patch/contribute to selenium on rails head 
  to the http://github.com/paytonrules/selenium-on-rails and fork the repo, then just 
  issue a pull request. I will not be taking patches that don’t have tests however, as 
  it is just too much work for me to retrofit tests on to the patch.
</p>
<p>
  For any questions or comments contact me at eric (at) 8thlight (dot) com. Look for me 
  at SDWest and Scotland on Rails.
