title: When is a Mock not a Mock

<h2>
  A couple of weeks ago I had to add a feature to some code that was written almost two 
  years ago. It was a pretty simple web service client that constructed some 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, using Ruby’s 
  <abbr title="Ruby Electric Extensible Markup Language">REXML</abbr> library, and made 
  the web service call via another library. A quick inventory shows two dependencies, 
  the web service call and <abbr title="Ruby Electric Extensible Markup Language">REXML</abbr>, 
  so that’s what I expected to see when I came across the tests. But what did I see? Paraphrasing:
</h2>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-1.rb"></script>
<p>
  Of course the send_message call contained the construction of the 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> so that there was no test that the 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> being constructed was correct.  
  Heck that was all that was being done in the class, and a closer inspection of the tests 
  revealed that all they were doing was testing the error handling by changing the return 
  value of parse_response. This is a classic sign that the developer at the time couldn’t 
  figure out how to stub out the actual dependency, and so they did the next best thing, 
  they stubbed out the caller.
</p>
<p>
  I knew this was wrong, but I had an iteration meeting the next day and still had to update 
  the .NET web service that this code was calling.  So I started to just go ahead and make 
  the untested change, but then my Clean Code wristband started burning until I couldn’t take 
  it any more.  I had to get the <abbr title="Ruby Electric Extensible Markup Language">REXML</abbr> 
  library under test.  So what to do?  Well the 
  <abbr title="Ruby Electric Extensible Markup Language">REXML</abbr> construction looked like 
  this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-2.rb"></script>
<p>
  Okay I know how to do this normally. The first test was simple:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-3.rb"></script>
<p>
  It passed! What was so hard about testing this anyway? Okay let’s test that the elements are 
  set:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-4.rb"></script>
<p>
  Oh that sucks!  Since the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> 
  doesn’t run entirely through the doc object I have to stub elements, then stub each 
  individual element, then should_receive on text, and if I want to be perfect I can stub 
  out the array accessor too.  I have to should_receive for each element name, the tests 
  will be hard to follow and fragile.  Now I get why the original developer punted on this.  
  There’s got to be a better way.  I can start expecting actual 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, but from past experience I know 
  that leads to very hard to read tests that give errors that aren’t easy to diagnose.  
  What I really care about is that the elements in this hash-like structure have their 
  text element set to the right data.  After trying out several approaches I had a moment 
  of inspiration, I want a struct!  Must be my inner C programmer.  If elements was a hash 
  of structs, I could just check their text values are set.  This way I’m testing that I’m 
  using the <abbr title="Ruby Electric Extensible Markup Language">REXML</abbr> library 
  right rather than testing the library itself.  If only Ruby had a struct concept&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  I suppose you’ve already figured out that it does, haven’t you?
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-5.rb"></script>
<p>
  What that does is setup a class named MockElement, with the accessor text. When is a 
  Mock not a Mock? When it’s really a Fake. Instead of stubbing out elements to return 
  yet another mock, elements will return a hash of the element names I know I’m using 
  that point to these fake elements. Then after making the call in the client, I’ll just 
  check that the text is set properly. This is best demonstrated with an example:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057097.js?file=esmith-20090110-6.rb"></script>
<p>
  Aha! Now I’ve tested that the <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> was 
  properly constructed without relying on looking at the actual 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> text itself and without stubbing 
  out the class itself. The code is cleaner, the tests are easier to understand, and I 
  can implement my new feature. More importantly, my wristband stopped burning.
