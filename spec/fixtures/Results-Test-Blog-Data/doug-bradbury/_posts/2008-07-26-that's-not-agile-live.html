<p>
	About a year ago, I wrote 
	<a href"http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2007/08/05/thats-not-agile">That’s not Agile</a>. 
	The idea has grown a bit since then and I will be presenting it as a 
	<a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/3144">workshop</a> at Agile 2008. If you are 
	coming to Toronto, please consider coming to check out the workshop. It all happens Thursday 
	morning (8/7) at 8:30 am.
</p>	
<p>
	In this workshop we’ll be looking at the differences between the practices of Agile and the 
	values/beliefs in Agile. We’ll explore questions like “What makes a practice Agile?” “Is it 
	your practices that make you Agile or you beliefs?”
</p>
<p>
	I’m especially hoping to find some people in the room who have been on a team that has struggled 
	in transitioning to Agile.
</p>
<p>
	See you in Toronto!
