  <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2008/12/20/embedded-ruby-first-steps">Last Time</a> 
  I got ruby up and running on my Arm based embedded development platform. Here is a quick 
  summary of what Santa and I did over Christmas.
</h2>
<h3>Sockets</h3>
<p>
  Getting support for sockets built into Ruby turned out to not be hard at all. 
  All I had to do has uncomment the extensions I wanted in ext/Setup. Here is everything 
  I decided to turn on. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1052016.js?file=dbradbury-20081230-1.txt%20"></script>
<p>
  After a rebuild and reinstall, I could require and use 'socket.' Welcome, Ruby, to the 
  outside world!
</p>
<h3>Relocating Ruby</h3>
<p>
  I decided to move ruby to the 'standard' install directory (/usr/local/) instead of the 
  root that I had done in the first iteration. This would avoid having to set the RUBYLIB 
  environment variable and keep any mess I made out out of the main system /bin and /lib 
  directories. First I removed the --prefix from the configure script I had written last 
  time. This will cause Ruby to build assuming the default install location (/usr/local/). 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1052016.js?file=dbradbury-20081230-2.sh"></script>
<p>
  After Ruby was built, but before installing it (make install), I hacked the DESTDIR in 
  rbconfig.rb
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1052016.js?file=dbradbury-20081230-3.sh"></script>
<p>
  This created the /usr/local tree inside my install directory. I created a /usr/local/ on 
  my file system and copied that tree over. The only problem with this process is that the 
  sh-bang line on the top of all of the ruby scrips (irb, testrb, etc.) had the wrong path 
  in them. They had the install path on the host machine (/~/ruby/install/usr/local/bin/ruby) 
  instead of the actual path on the target (/usr/local/bin/ruby). I changed those by hand. 
</p>
<h3>Sinatra</h3>
<p>
  Ahh, now the good part.  Using a gem on an embedded system is an interesting problem.  I 
  first had to get rubygems installed on the network files system.  I downloaded the 
  <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126&amp;release_id=9501"> source code</a> and 
  temporarily placed in on the target files system.  On the target I ran the install command.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1052016.js?file=dbradbury-20081230-4.sh"></script>
<p>
  I found it more convenient to install the gems from the host system instead of the target. 
  It would be faster and the 'gem' command had some ruby dependencies that I hadn't yet build. 
  I downloaded Sinatra and Rack and then manually installed them into my target's file system 
  on the host machine. Note that /arm/fs/ is the root of my networked file system. I switched 
  off rdoc and ri to help keep the install small. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1052016.js?file=dbradbury-20081230-5.sh"></script>
<p>
  With Sinatra installed and ready to go, I wrote a quick Sinatra app. Sinatra runs on Mongrel 
  by default, but I wanted to run on the lighter weight Webrick web server which was already in 
  my ruby installation.

<p>
  Drum roll please ...
</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
  I've been plugging away on the linux device and ruby extension side of the project. I'm still 
  on the steep side of the learning curve, but making progress. I'm still after that elusive blinking 
  LED!
