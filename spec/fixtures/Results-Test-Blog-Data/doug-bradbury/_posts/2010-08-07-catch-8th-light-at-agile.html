<h3>Software Craftsmanship Practices- Micah Martin</h3>
<p>
  How does one become a Master Craftsman? Practice, practice, practice. In this workshop 
  we will get our hands dirty exploring some of the more common techniques for practicing 
  the software craft. We will perform code katas, working on sense of code smell, do some 
  randori, and more. Bring your laptop and prepare for a mental workout. You will learn 
  exercises that you can use to train yourself at home and teach your colleagues. <i>Room A-4</i>

<h3>Walk and Code - Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis - Doug Bradbury</h3>
<p>
  Life as a programmer is primarily sedentary. Most of the day, a programmer sits in front 
  of a computer moving little more than fingers. Dr. James Levine of the Mayo Clinic has been 
  doing some fascinating research on the health benefits of non-exercise activity. He has 
  pioneered the concept of active workstations to promote an overall healthier life for people 
  with typically sedentary jobs. I have taken his advice to heart and built a walking treadmill 
  desk that I use everyday as I write code. I will present Dr. Levine's research and report on 
  my first 6 months on the treadmill desk. <i>Room: Asia 1</i>

<h3>Zero to Clojure in 90 Minutes - Colin Jones</h3>
<p>
  We all know that learning one new language a year is a great goal for improvement as an Agile 
  developer who wants to be more effective. However, it can be a bit intimidating to get started 
  in a new language, especially one that looks very different from what you're used to. Many 
  developers are responding to change (in a macro sense) by learning Clojure, which brings together 
  the expressiveness and power of Lisp, fantastic concurrency semantics, and the rich libraries 
  of Java. It allows for great simplicity of code, which translates to fewer mistakes and more 
  working software.<i> Room: Asia 1</i>
