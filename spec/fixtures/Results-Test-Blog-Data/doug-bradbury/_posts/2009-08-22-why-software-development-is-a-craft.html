title: Why Software Development is a Craft

<h2>
  Craftsmanship has been used as a metaphor for software development. Pete McBreen argues 
  in his book “Software Craftsmanship” that craft is a better metaphor for software 
  development than is engineering or science.
</h2>
<p>
  I take the association one step further and claim that it craft is not just a good 
  metaphor for software development, but that software development is literally a craft.
</p>
<h3>The Hand and the Eye</h3>
<p>
  A key facet of historical craft is the intimate connection between the hand and the 
  eye. A furniture maker cuts a joint with his hands, then fits the two pieces together. 
  If the alignment isn’t perfect, he sands and trims and fills until the joint is true. 
  It’s a cycle of shaping and observing. A glass blower turns the bead of molten glass 
  over and over in a steady rhythm as she shapes the glass towards its final form. Her 
  eye informs her hands and she constantly sees the effects of the changing speed and 
  angle of the turning rod.
</p>
<p>
  Code is a physical thing. Though technically code is nothing more than some states 
  stored on a fast spinning magnetic disk, it is just as physical as a lump of clay. 
  Consider the language used when talking about code. It is touched, shaped, moved, 
  broken, cut, pasted, fiddled with, tweaked, and played with. It is the physicality of 
  code that enables the feedback between the hand and the eye. It is touched and a 
  change is observed.
</p>
<p>
  This is why Test Driven Development is such a key practice in software craftsmanship. 
  There was a time when a programmer would write a bunch of code and try it out hours or 
  even days later. The time between making something with the hand and seeing the results 
  was long. When a programmer writes a little bit of test code and runs it, then a little 
  bit of production code and runs it, this cycle shrinks to minutes or even seconds. The 
  connection between the hand and the eye increases. The craftsman immediately sees the 
  work of his hand.
</p>
<h3>Making</h3>
<p>
  Another element that makes software development a literal craft is that software development 
  is a process of making. Contrast that to engineering. What is the primary activity of an 
  engineer? It is design. A civil engineer designs a bridge that an ironworker builds. The 
  electrical engineer doesn’t typically etch or populate the circuit board. She designs a 
  circuit that is printed on a board and populated by either machine or technician.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, the software craftsman doesn’t just design the software (though she does do that), 
  she also makes it. She writes the code that makes it work. There is little manufacturing 
  involved in taking the made software and putting it in the hands of the person who will use it. 
  Sometimes there is a deployment to a server or perhaps a CD is burnt and packaged in a box. 
  But often even these tasks are performed or automated by the maker herself.
</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>
  Historical craftsmen have always been makers. The potter makes a vessel; the blacksmith, a 
  horseshoe; the weaver, a garment. These makers have always had close connection to the raw 
  material of their work: the wool, the iron, and the clay. What then is the raw material of 
  software craftsmanship? What is the material of which software is made?
</p>
<p>
  The material of software is language. Java, Ruby, C, Scala, Clojure, etc.: these syntaxes are 
  the medium in which the software craftsman works. What makes this media so interesting is that 
  the materials themselves are composite materials made of more primitive materials. Beneath Ruby 
  code lies an interpreter built in C which is compiled by a compiler. The most basic of which is 
  built in an assembly language which is assembled by an assembler which is built in the most primitive 
  machine language which is read directly by the computer’s processor. Each new language emerges 
  out of other languages as craftsmen explore the materials and invent new ways of combining and 
  deconstructing what they have at hand.
</p>
<p>
  It’s similar to metal alloys like steel. Iron is combined with other metals to make an new raw 
  material whose strength enables the construction of enormous buildings. Each new language innovation 
  gives the software craftsman a new, more powerful material from which to build both larger and simpler 
  systems.
</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>
  A discussion of software as craft isn’t complete without mentioning tools. A software craftsman does 
  deal with the hardware on which his software runs, but the more interesting tool set is the software 
  that the craftsman uses to write code. The text editor or development environment, the unit testing 
  framework, the continuous integration system, and the acceptance test system are the tools of the software 
  craftsman’s trade. Because these tools are built from the same raw materials as the thing being made, 
  software craftsmen have the ability like historical craftsmen to be tool makers.
</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>
  The final argument for treating software development as a literal craft is the way in which it is 
  learned. A traditional college education in computer engineering or computer science produces graduates 
  woefully unprepared to develop software. The best way to learn how to make software is to sit down with 
  someone who knows how to do it and learn from them. This is currently being displayed in many shops 
  throughout the world that are embracing an apprenticeship model for training and growth. This model has 
  been used for centuries to pass on crafts from one generation to the next.
</p>
<h3>Software is Craft</h3>
<p>
  The Software Craftsmanship community is growing and having some fabulous discussions. I think that this 
  is largely a result of people not just using craftsmanship as a way to talk about or explain software, 
  but embracing and practicing software as a literal craft. The historical crafts have begun to inform us 
  in the software craft and have helped us develop our practice. Most metaphors break down when taken too 
  far, but software-as-craft isn’t losing any steam. Perhaps that is because the association is more than 
  metaphor and software really is a craft.
