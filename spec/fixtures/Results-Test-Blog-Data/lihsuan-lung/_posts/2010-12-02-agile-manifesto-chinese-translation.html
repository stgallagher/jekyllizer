title: Agile Manifesto Chinese Translation

<p>
  At Agile Conference 2010, I was fortunate enough to share a shuttle bus with Henrik Kniberg and 
  César Idrovo Carrillo, the organizers of the manifesto translation project, on my way to airport.
</p>
<p>
  They offered me some of their stories from translating to interacting with their local Agile community.
  In return, I would like to take this opportunity to share my own account as a contributor to the 
  traditional Chinese translation.
</p>
<p>
  I was first introduced to the project through my mentor, Doug Bradbury, while I was still apprenticing at
  8th Light. Chinese translation did not take off until a month later when a Chinese coach joined the team. 
  More and more Chinese translators have joined since then and eventually a team was formed to specialize
  in traditional Chinese.
</p>
<p>
  The traditional Chinese team is led by Steven Mak (Hong Kong) and Chris Torng (Taiwan). Steven serves
  as our advisor and contact with Henrik while Chris is in charge of leading and coordinating the project.
  We mainly collaborate with the Taiwan Scrum group on Facebook and have made many significant changes based
  on their suggestions.
</p>
<p>
  We began our work in May 2010 and released our final draft on November 19th of the same year. Specifically,
  we translated the four Agile values and twelve principles into traditional Chinese for people in Hong Kong,
  Macau, Taiwan, and many oversea Chinese communities to read in the comfort of their native language and
  orthography.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the problems that we faced arose from the absence of cognate words in the two languages. Instead,
  we were forced into translating the terms in a looser manner than we had hoped. This caused us to question
  whether working software is software able to be compiled, functional, or usable.
</p>
<p>
  We also wondered whether the art of minimizing the work done is a fine art or skill, and whether the work
  not done is work in progress or work with less business value. As translators, our main concerns are not to
  force our interpretation onto readers before they can form their own opinions or, worse, to offer a
  misleading interpretation.
</p>
<p>
  Chris started collecting all the official and unofficial existing translated documents on the manifesto.
  We also received consent from the Chinese translators of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns,
  and Practices to use their work. By bringing together all the references we could find, we were able to
  achieve a translation of a quality we were all satisfied with.
</p>
<p>
  In retrospect, there were a few things we could have done or avoided to make the project continue in a
  smoother manner. It took more time than I had hoped to get the project off ground initially. In particular,
  it was tedious to establish the distinctiveness of traditional Chinese.
</p>
<p> 
  I also felt that it was hard to set a timeline for the project based on everyone’s work schedules.
  This was, perhaps, inevitable because of the nature of volunteering work and other obligations such as our jobs.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, despite the small drawbacks the project was very successful. I believe the manifesto along with
  the many great conversations that we incepted will benefit the future development of Agile practices in
  traditional Chinese communities.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I would like to thank everyone I mentioned above and list here for contributing to this project
  in various ways: Aska Lee, Kc Chao, David Ko, Wen-Hsiao Lee, and the rest of Scrum Community in Taiwan.
  And Kimberly Sheen of Ave Maria University’s Canizaro Library for editing this article.
