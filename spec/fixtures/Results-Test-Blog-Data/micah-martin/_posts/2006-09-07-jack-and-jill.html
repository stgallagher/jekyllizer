  Once upon a time there live a young girl named Jill and her next door neighbor Jack. 
  Perhaps you’ve heard of them. When Jack and Jill were about 5 years old they both 
  desperately wanted to learn how to ride a bike. Jill’s father, being a practical man, 
  bought Jill a nice child-size bike and took Jill outside to practice riding the bike 
  every chance he got. Jill’s dad would hold Jill up right and move with her while she 
  pedalled. Within a few days Jill was able to ride for moments at a time without her 
  father’s support. After another day, Jill could ride her bike all by herself.

  Now Jack’s family was a bit more rigorous. Jack’s father thought it important that 
  Jack have a solid understanding of bike riding and the science behind it before he 
  start riding a bike. So instead of a bike, Jake’s dad bought various books on physics 
  and cycling history. For weeks Jack learned from his father much about kinetic and 
  potential energy. He gained an understanding for gyroscopic forces and much, much more. 
  After about a month, Jack knew everything there was to know about bike riding. It was 
  at this point that Jack’s dad bought a bicycle for Jack. Jack proudly mounted the bike 
  and promptly fell off. He mounted the bike again, peddling slowly and ended up in 
  another painful fall. Meanwhile Jill was effortlessly riding her bike around block, 
  feeling bad for her friend Jack.

  Later in life both Jack and Jill graduated high school and wanted nothing more than 
  to become software developers. Jack, following societal protocol, applied to a 
  prestigious university was accepted to the computer science (CS) program. At the 
  onset of his first semester, Jack was mildly disappointed to find that CS program 
  alloted only one class in the first semester that had anything to do with computers. 
  This class was called “Computer Algorithms I” and involved no programming what so ever. 
  Other than this Jack learned Calculus, Philosophy, and other peripheral classes… lots 
  of classes that had nothing to do with computers.

  Meanwhile Jill moved to Chicago to become an apprentice for a renowned software company. 
  On day 1 Jill was learning to write Python code as she worked side by side with an expert 
  programmer. Like a kid in a candy store, Jill was nearly overwhelmed with all the 
  software knowledge and learning experiences surrounding her. It was great!

  After a few years, Jack had graduated. With all the calculus, differential equations, 
  spanish, number theory, and computer architecture classes, there was no doubt that Jack 
  was a full fledged CS graduate. It didn’t matter that he had only written a couple hundred 
  lines of code by this time… He had a bachelor’s degree! Jack soon landed a programming 
  job in the IT department of a large company. On his first day Jack was introduced to the 
  project he’d work on. He met the team, found his desk and was anxious to get started. Later 
  that day his project manager walked in with a thick binder titled “Data Model/Object Model” 
  and said “Read this by next week”.

  At around the same time Jill already knew how to program in Python, Java, C#, and had dabbled 
  in a few other languages as well. Object Orientated principles and pattern came naturally to 
  Jill since she had used them extensively on a daily basis. Having worked on a few successful 
  projects she knew a bit about managing projects and what it takes to get them done. No doubt 
  about it, Jill was a software developer to be reckoned with.
