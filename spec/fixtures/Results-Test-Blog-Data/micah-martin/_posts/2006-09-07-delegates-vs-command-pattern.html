title: Delegates Vs Command Pattern
tag:
---


<p>
  Delegates: one of the few unique aspects of .NET. How useful are they?
</p>

<p>
  Here’s a delegate declaration.
</p>

<!--
private delegate double Operation(double a, double b);
-->

<p>
  That syntax can take some getting used to. In order to use the <b>Operation</b> 
  delegate we’ll need some methods that match the <b>double (double, double)</b> 
  form.
</p>

<!--
public static double Add(double a, double b)
{
    return a + b;
}

public static double Subtract(double a, double b)
{
    return a - b;
}

public static double Multiply(double a, double b)
{
    return a * b;
}

public static double Divide(double a, double b)
{
    return a / b;
}
-->

<p>
  There’s nothing special about that. Now to create an instance of the <b>Operation</b> 
  delegate.
</p>

<!--
Operation math = new Operation(Add)
-->

<p>
  Again the syntax can throw you off a bit. This line instantiates an instance of 
  <b>Operation</b> with the <b>Add</b> method and stores it in a variable named 
  <b>math</b>. To use <b>math</b> you invoke it as though you were calling a method.
</p>

<!--
double result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result: {0}", result);
>> 3
-->

<p>
  Invoking <b>math</b>, with parameters 1 and 2, actually called <b>Add</b> with 
  the same parameters, hence the result of 3. The oposite behavior can be achieved 
  by using the <b>Subtract</b> method instead of <b>Add</b>.
</p>

<!--
Operation math = new Operation(Subtract);
double result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result: {0}", result);
>> -1
-->

<p>
  <b>math</b> just delegated the call with parameters 1 and 2 to <b>Subtract</b> 
  and so the result was -1. So far this isn’t very useful. We can wrap methods up 
  in delegates and call methods through the delegate but that’s just a lot of extra 
  work. The power of Delegates comes into play when you don’t know which method to 
  use. Assume this code was used in a bank system. A frequent action of a bank 
  system is to adjust the balance of an account.
</p>
 
<!--
private double balance = 0;
public void AdjustBalanceBy(double adjustment, Operation operation)
{
    double newBalance = operation(balance, adjustment);
    LogAdjustment(balance, newBalance);
    balance = newBalance;
}
-->

<p>
  Notice that <b>AdjustBalanceBy</b> takes an <b>Operation</b> Which means it could be 
  <b>Add</b>, <b>Subtract</b>, <b>Multiply</b>, or <b>Divide</b> to adjust the balance. 
  There might be operations we haven’t considered yet like applying interest. 
  <b>AdjustBalanceBy</b> could take care of that for us as long as we give it a delegate 
  that calls <b>ApplyInterest(double, double)</b>. The code in <b>AdjustBalanceBy</b> 
  would never have to change and that’s exactly how the Open/Closed Principle says it 
  should be. How would this be done without delegates? The Command Pattern would work 
  great!
</p>

<!--
public interface Operation
{
    double Run(double a, double b);
}

public class Add : Operation
{
    public double Run(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Subtract: Operation
{
    public double Run(double a, double b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }
}
...
public void AdjustBalanceBy(double adjustment, Operation operation)
{
    double newBalance = operation.Run(balance, adjustment);
    LogAdjustment(balance, newBalance);
    balance = newBalance;
}
-->

<p>
  There’s a bit more code without delegates but we’re saved from the wacky syntax. 
  Considering the extra language complexity of delegates, I feel the Command pattern 
  has the upper hand here. Point for Command Pattern. !meta Delegates 0 - Command 
  Pattern 1
</p>
  
<h3>What about multicasting?</h1>

<p>
  Delegates have this feature called multicasting that allows you to add multiple 
  delegates together. Here’s an example.
</p>
  
<!--
Operator math = new Operator(Add);
math += new Operator(Subtract);
math += new Operator(Multiply);
math += new Operator(Divide);
math(1, 2);
-->

<p>
  When <b>math</b> is called at the bottom, all four operations are performed. In this case it’s not particularly useful but for something like a button, where, when clicked, multiple actions need to take place, multicasting is very convenient. But what happens to all the return values? Each of the methods combined in the math delegate above returns a value but <b>math</b> can only return one value.

<!--
Operation math = new Operation(add);
double result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result 1: {0}", result);

math += new Operation(subtract);
result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result 2: {0}", result);

math += new Operation(multiply);
result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result 3: {0}", result);

math += new Operation(divide);
result = math(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine("result 4: {0}", result);

OUTPUT
>>result 1: 3
>>result 2: -1
>>result 3: 2
>>result 4: 0.5
-->

<p>
  Interesting. Multicasted delegates only return one value from the combined execution. 
  This suggests that multicasting should only be used when you don’t really care what 
  the return values are. The Command Pattern alone can’t compete with multicasting 
  but along with his good buddy Composite, they’ve got things under control.
</p>  

<!--
public class Composite : Operation
{
    IList operations = new ArrayList();

    public double Run(double a, double b)
    {
        double result = 0;
        foreach(Operation o in operations)
            result = o.Run(a, b);

        return result;
    }

    public void AddOperation(Operation o)
    {
        operations.Add(o);
    }
}
-->

<p>
  This version of Composite mimics the delegate’s handling of the return values 
  but it could easily average them, store them in a list, or do whatever else 
  your funny bone fancies. Composite gives much more control over combined 
  execution and so I say it earns another point for Command Pattern. !meta 
  Delegates 0 - Command Pattern 2
</p>
  
<h3>Events</h3>

<p>Oh gosh. Get a load of this syntax.</p>

<!--
button.Click += new System.EventHandler(SomeAction);
-->

<p>
  An intuitive interpretation: <b>button.Click</b> - Telling the button that 
  it was clicked <b>button.Click +=</b> - Adding something to the clicking of 
  the button… Huh? <b>new System.EventHandler(SomeAction) - SomeAction</b> must 
  be a method the fits the <b>EventHandler</b> method form. An instance of 
  <b>EventHandler</b> is created with <b>SomeAction</b>. After those logical 
  steps a developer concludes that <b>Click</b> must be a public field (or 
  property) of <b>Button</b> of <b>EventHandler</b> which is a delegate. And 
  the developer would be wrong! <b>Click</b> is actually an Event. The 
  declaration looks something like this:
</p>

<!--
public event System.EventHandler Click;
-->

<p>
  The whole Event construct is rather silly because, as far as I can tell, 
  it could just as easily be replaced with a public field (or property). 1 
  point deduction from delegates for flagrant misuse of syntax.
</p>

  Final Score
  Delegates: -1

  —- !commentForm “There’s a bit more code without delegates but we’re saved 
  from the wacky syntax. Considering the extra language complexity of delegates, 
  I feel the Command pattern has the upper hand here” What is complex about 
  the keyword delegate followed by the required signature of your choosing? 
  In what way is this “wacky”? Clutching at straws is the phrase that springs 
  to mind. * The declaration of delegates is not terribly complex. It’s the use 
  of delegates that’s complex. <b>Operation operation</b> - It looks like a regular object 
  but you can’t use it like a regular object. <b>operation(…)</b> ”Why is operation being 
  invoked as though it were a method? Why can’t all objects be invoked like methods?” 
  When you come across delegates in code there’s moment of confusion where you have 
  to figure out that the variable that you thought was an object is really a delegate. 
  - MicahMartin ”Delegates make functions first class objects, this is actually what 
  the command pattern is trying to emulate, how can you possibly object to that? 
  In version 2.0, anonymous delegates extend this to make lambda’s possible, this 
  is fantastic, and far better than the command pattern.” “How would this be done 
  without delegates? The Command Pattern would work great!” Yes it would and as 
  much as we would like everyone to be aware of and study design patterns not everyone 
  will. Therefore when they study dotnet and come across this concept supported in 
  their language they will be able to use and benefit from it without even being aware 
  of the command pattern. If and when they move on to design patterns they will be in 
  the comforting position of knowing two approaches to a particular problem and can 
  weigh up for themselves the pros and cons of each method. * Good point. Having 
  delegate-like functionality built into the language is very powerful. In fact Ruby, 
  my favorite language, would not be half as wonderful without blocks. Languages like 
  Ruby and Smalltalk have very elegant implementations of blocks and closures. 
  Delegates are not elegant. - MicahMartin “The Command Pattern alone can’t compete 
  with multicasting but along with his good buddy Composite, they’ve got things under 
  control.” And so we keep on adding patterns just to get the same level of functionality 
  that multi-cast delegates offer? Aren’t you people the same ones that tell us not to 
  add patterns for the sake of it? Refactoring to Patterns by Josh Kerievsky, anyone? 
  How often will you need the return values from multi-cast delegates? Depends, is the 
  answer. Therefore if you don’t, multicasting is fine and less work. * Agreed. When 
  programming in .NET there’s no point in fighting it; you have to use delegates. When 
  you don’t need the return value, multicasting is easier. - MicahMartin ”delegates make 
  multicast commands first class, that’s better than a command composite.” “The whole 
  Event construct is rather silly because, as far as I can tell, it could just as easily 
  be replaced with a public field (or property).” Not sure what you are getting at here 
  but then I’m not sure what you are getting at in the whole article. Your remark “as far 
  as I can tell” implies to me that you haven’t actually spent that much effort getting 
  to know dotnet. It seems to me an exercise in Microsoft bashing yet again. I’m guessing 
  you’re a Sun worshipper (of the Java kind). Perhaps you should applaud MS for its efforts 
  in helping “mortal” developers get good code written quickly instead of finding any excuse 
  to criticize. * Do an experiment. Next time you’re about to declare an event, declare a 
  public instance of a delegate instead: <b>public Operation myEvent = new Operation(Add);</b>. 
  It’ll work just like an event. One benefit of this alternative to events is that you 
  won’t have to worry about the annoying null pointers that Thomas describes below. - 
  MicahMartin ”Incorrect, event is an access modifier, all events are delegates, event 
  simply means that only += and -= can be used, with a public delegate, one could replace 
  the entire delegate via assignment, killing all previous subscribers. The event keyword 
  enforces the observer pattern. Public delegates allow aButton.Click = new EventHandler(MyAction), 
  Public event delegates allow aButton.Click += new EventHandler(MyAction) and =- new 
  EventHandler(MyAction), but not =, this is vital.” Steve Bate —- “Button.Click += …” 
  The most silly thing about this syntax is that the Click spontaniously changes from null 
  to something on the first +=, and suddenly becomes null when you apply -= a certain amount 
  of times. So after an operation when you expect to remove something from a collection, 
  the collection itself becomes null. That’s why you usually see a test for null just before 
  an event is invoked. Why they invented this and why they think this is smart, is beyond me. 
  Worse is that it seems it’s not fixed in Whidbey. Thomas Eyde * I agree wholeheartedly. 
  When I teach C# classes, students trip over this quirkiness like clockwork. - MicahMartin 
  ”There’s nothing weird about that, it’s quite natural… Click += new Action, allows Click 
  to act as both AddListener and RemoveListener, and makes perfect sense, since Click is a 
  list of actions. It’s a nice use of operator overloading to simplify the common action of 
  adding and removing event listeners.” —- Yes, it is a shame. The thing that I think is 
  worst about the event/delegate mechanism is that it doesn’t evolve well. Imagine having an 
  event called TransactionAdded. It’s an event so anyone can attach a delegate to it to find 
  out when a transaction was added. Okay, now what should we do if we need another event 
  called TransactionUpdated? Easy. We add it. But, is that the best thing? Now we have two 
  events that people have to register for when they want to know about transaction operations. 
  If we’d used a interface, a listener with two methods (added, updated) we could’ve just 
  registered an object. ”A delegate is essentially a one method interface, and covers by far 
  the vast majority of UI cases of listening to events, and nothigng prevents you from doing 
  as you suggest, so what’s the complaint? Interfaces force you to declare objects to implement 
  them, delegates are move flexible and allow you to pass any function that matches the correct 
  signature, this allows polymorphism without forcing you to implement an interface, a great 
  advantage when you don’t have access to the original source. Delegates are an extra tool that 
  give you more flexibility than interfaces.” The sad thing about the event/delegate mechanism 
  is that it lulls you in with the event for that first method, especially with the multicast 
  feature. After you have that first event, many people will add a second and third event rather 
  than refactor to an interface and a list of objects. In fact, I’m working with another team 
  that’s done this just today. - MichaelFeathers ”Everything has potential for abuse, that doesn’t 
  mean we shouldn’t want those extra tools. Delegates give you something interfaces can’t, 
  polymorphism at the method level, rather than the object level, why wouldn’t you want that?” —- 
  Why not use both? I use the Command Pattern and Delegates/Events. The fact is that the .NET 
  Framework has the Button.Click += new EventHandler() syntax built in and that is how events are 
  handled. So in my event handlers I execute Command objects and add them to a Command Stack 
  (when necessary). This allows me to take advantage of the nice code completion in Visual Studio, 
  while still using the nifty GoF Pattern.
</p>  

<!--
...

private CommandStack _commandStack = new CommandStack();
someButton.Click += new EventHandler(myEventHandler);

protected void myEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs args)
{
     _commandStack.Execute(new SmurfCommand("Kill Gargamel!"));
}
...
-->

<p>
  Regardless, I think the intention of delegates was not to piss off GoF loyalists, but 
  rather to introduce a better way of doing function pointers. Likewise the intention of 
  events was to offer a different approach to anonymous methods & classes (though in C# 2 
  anonymous methods/classes are brought in). After all C# is named C# because the language 
  is like C++, only sharper (or duller if you ask a POJO). ;) - Ben Monro !* Tue, 20 Sep 
  2005 09:10:10, Dave, Instance Methods A comparison of delegates and the command pattern 
  using only static methods is only half the story. Using instance methods for delegates 
  is quite simple, but emulating the functionality in the command pattern, while also simple, 
  adds still more clutter to create and manage the additional object reference in each command 
  class, and even if you favour the command pattern to save you learning a new syntax the extra 
  “boilerplate” clutter it involves shifts the clarity of the construct over to the delegate. 
  At least in my opinion. Another wrinkle is that the instance delegate implicitly has access 
  to private members of its class, while the command pattern can only access public members of 
  the referenced class, forcing you to expose a method to do the actual delegate work. Your 
  subtract operation becomes:
</p>
  
<!--
public class Subtract: Operation
{
        private ContextObject _c;
        Subtract (ContextObject c)
        {
             _c=c;

        }
    public double Run(double a, double b)
    {
        return _c.Run(a,b);
    }
}
-->

<p>
  That seems a lot of extra boilerplate per class when delegates get it for free via: math 
  = new Operation(c.Subtract); Worse, in this case I’ll already have c.Subtract written with 
  the correct signature for the command class to call…this reduces the ‘command’ class to little 
  more than an adapter that doesn’t really need to adapt anything. The entire class becomes 
  redundant! —- Tue, 20 Sep 2005 17:16:32, Michel, C++ Equivalents “Delegates: one of the few 
  unique aspects of .NET. How useful are they?” There are equivalents/alternatives to delegates 
  in C++ so I would argue they are unique to .NET. Look att boost.function/boost.signal in 
  conjunction with boost.bind gives a quite elegant and good alternative to the command pattern 
  and it avoids additional single method intermethods and virtual calls. Look at www.boost.org 
  for more info. At least boost.function and boost.bind is going in to the TR1 C++ specification.

  complexity I’ll grant you I’d have liked an easier to explain model for “event”. It does make a 
  weird kind of sense once you know what it’s doing, but… feh. But the delegate itself really is 
  pretty straightforward. In most cases it gets me everything I wanted from the Command pattern, 
  and I find the shorter syntax to be more elegant. One other point: With pre-existing code of the 
  right interface, Command would need a new class for each method, but delegates would need nothing 
  at all. As for whether they are unique to .NET, well, actually no. The “closure” in Borland’s 
  C++ Builder is the same thing. That was of course a feature in Delphi. So Anders is fond of his 
  delegates. Me too! In the pre-Boost dark ages of C++ I tried to implement something like delegates. 
  It was functional, but never as clean as the modern delegate syntax. I have a healthy respect for 
  the complexity being hidden in there. (I’m even more impressed with Boost doing it without language 
  support, but I’m not doing much C++ lately so I haven’t used it.) Of course, in C++ we overloaded 
  operator() to help support this and could make any object look like a function call. So that part 
  didn’t surprise me at all about delegates. —- Fri, 20 Jan 2006 04:29:03, Norman Sasono, How about

  Much simpler in some other languages These patterns are much simpler in other languages that support 
  first class functions, like Python. For example, you would write: (Syntax may not be exact)
</p>

<!--
def add(a,b): return a+b
def subtract(a,b): return a-b
def multiply(a,b): return a*b
def divide(a,b): return a/b

def run(f,a,b): return f(a,b)
-->

<p>The run function could be called thus:</p>

<!--
run(add, 1, 2)
run(subtract, 1, 2)
run(multiply, 1, 2)
run(divide, 1, 2)
-->

<p>
  This, I believe, is much more expressive and intuitive. I believe Ruby lets you do this 
  too. And of course, so does Lisp. Notice the difference in syntax between the C# delegate 
  and the simplicity of Python. —- Mon, 23 Jan 2006 13:07:41, , Nowhere in the .NET literature 
  are delegates ever described to be a replacement for the Command pattern. They are always 
  used for the observer pattern or for “glue code” between components or where you would 
  otherwise have to define an interface with one method (like Runnable in Java). —- Mon, 23 
  Jan 2006 14:51:25, , C# is not that different from Python In C# the code looks very close to 
  Python. The biggest difference is the explicit types.
</p>
  
<!--
int Add(int x, int y) { return x + y; };
int Sub(int x, int y) { return x + y; };

run(Add, 1, 2);
run(Sub, 1, 2);
...
-->

<p>You can use anonymous functions, like Python’s lambda operator:</p>

<!--
run(delegate(int x, int y){return x*y;}, 1, 2);

  And, better than Python, anonymous functions are not limited to expressions.
