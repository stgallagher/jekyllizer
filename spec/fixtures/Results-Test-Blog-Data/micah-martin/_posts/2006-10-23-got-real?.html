title: Got Real?

<p>
  I heard about the Getting Real workshop from a good friend who is a web 
  designer/developer. We used to talk some time ago about using the UI as 
  a tool to drive the development and he told me I should go to the workshop 
  if I could. I have to be honest, I didn’t know that much about 37signals 
  and (you’re welcome to laugh) I didn’t know that one of the speakers was 
  actually the creator of RubyOnRails.
</p>

<p>
  A bit skeptic, I read a blog from somebody that participated in one of 
  the workshops last year and my interest kept growing and growing. I told 
  one of the company’s partners to give it a try and to my surprise he 
  registered everybody for it. “The workshop better be good!” I said to 
  myself.
</p>  

<p>
  So there we were, sitting down and waiting to see what these 37signals 
  guys had to say. Right at the beginning of the presentation I learned 
  that a businessman (Jason), a programmer (David) and a UI designer (Ryan) 
  would be the speakers. It sounded like a success formula to me: it would 
  not be about some nerds talking about adding the digit 2 in the 0-1 binary 
  language; it would be about REAL-world professionals talking about REAL 
  web/product development approached from diverse angles beyond the plain 
  and traditional “bit-and-bytes” speech I am used to hear in that kind of 
  activities.
</p>  

<p>What a way to start!</p>

<p>
  The speakers did a good job on keeping people interested while sharing 
  without any hesitation the fruits of several years of pragmatic experience. 
  Their advice was rich and wide: from how to integrate organically the 
  layout and usability design with the programming endeavor using the 
  application itself as a real “wireframe”; to business-oriented tips like 
  how to hire the right people effectively. As an architect (on the traditional 
  sense - building design!) it was refreshing to see Christopher Alexander 
  “in-action” on some of their slides while talking about design patterns; 
  and to hear about 37signals’ approach to Mies Van Der Rohe’s aphorism “less 
  is more” applied to all aspects of the product development.

  The workshop was great, definitely worth the time and investment and I have 
  no hesitation recommending it to everyone that wants a more “holistic” and 
  practical exposition to what software development should really be (if you 
  want to Get Real!). A sincere “thank you” to the 37signals guys and to everyone 
  there that helped to enrich the workshop with questions and comments.
