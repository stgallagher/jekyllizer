<p>The milestones in the life of a story:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creation: customer creates the story</li>
  <li>Estimation: the story is estimated by developers</li>
  <li>Selection: the story is selected for an iteration</li>
  <li>Specification: tests are written the story</li>
  <li>Implementation: the story is implemented to make the tests pass</li>
  <li>Acceptance: the customer acknowledges completion of the story after seeing the 
      passing tests and witnessing the new functionality</li>
</ol>

<p>
  It is unavoidable. Every story must go through these milestones of life in order. A 
  story cannot be estimated if it has not been created. A story cannot be selected for an 
  iteration if it has not first been estimated. You can attempt to specify a story before 
  it has been selected but you run the risk of being wrong, for the system may change many 
  times before the story is selected. Implementing a story before it has been specified will 
  lead to false implementations. And accepting a story that hasn’t been implemented is just 
  plain silly.
</p>

<p>
  It happens with some frequency, however, that a story gets implemented before it is ever 
  selected, estimated, or perhaps even created. How? A developer may be look at a piece of 
  code and think, “Hey, the customer mentioned he wanted to change this doohickey. I might as 
  well change it now.”. Or a developer may working on one feature and say, “You know, I bet the 
  customer would really like it if I improved this thing-a-magigger”. When this happens, the 
  developer pridefully demonstrates the extra functionality to the customer and says with a 
  smile, “You got a Freebie this iteration!”.
</p>  

<p>
  BEWARE THE FREEBIE! A Freebie, by it’s nature, has skipped at least one milestone in it’s 
  life. Most Freebies skip the Selection milestone. This is unfortunate because maybe the 
  customer didn’t really want that story after all. But that’s small potatoes compared to the 
  real danger… Almost all Freebies have skipped the Specification milestone.
</p>

<p>
  Skipping the specification milestone is blasphemous. If a feature has not been specified 
  with tests, how do you know it really works? Worse, how will you know if it still works 2 
  months from now. Very often Freebies break and nobody knows about it.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve seen it over and over and it’s regrettable every time. A perfectly innocent story is 
  wronged by an overzealous developer. The poor story, out of sync from his peers, strays from 
  the trodden path and becomes a Ghost Story. Becoming a Ghost Story is dreadful fate. They are 
  those stories that were at one time complete, but have since become incomplete. You may never 
  actually see a ghost story but they will surely haunt you. They cause users to have delusions 
  of non-existant functionality and to make exclamations like “Hey! Why doesn’t this stupid app 
  work like it used to?” or “What happened to my favorite feature?”. They keep customers up at 
  night wondering if they actually selected the Ghost Story for an iteration of not. They torment 
  developers forcing them to write code they’ve already written.
</p>  

<p>
  Avoid Ghost Stories by avoiding Freebies. Give every story a complete life with all it’s 
  milestones. The next time a developers shows you extra functionality and calls it a Freebie, 
  say “That’s nice. I’ll consider selecting a story for that in a future iteration.”
