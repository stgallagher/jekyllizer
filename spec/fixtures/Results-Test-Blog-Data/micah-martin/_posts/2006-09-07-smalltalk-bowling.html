<p>
  I’ve been meaning to learn Smalltalk for years now. Recently Dave Astels and I have 
  a had a few discussion on the topic. They all seem to circulate around the theme of 
  Smalltalk being a key OO language of the past, and again in the near future. Now that
   Ruby has finally captures the attention it deserves, it’s not long before Smalltalk 
   is back in the spotlight.
</p> 

<p>
  A few days ago, when he joined me for a train ride, I seized the opportunity and asked 
  him to help me write some Smalltalk. He gave me a copy of Squeak and off we went to write 
  the Bowling game.
</p>

<p>
  Even though we only got through the first two test cases, Dave’s a good teacher and I 
  was able to finish it on my own. The code is below.
</p>

<p>
  My first impression of Smalltalk: “Damn, this requires a lot of clicking”. It requires 
  two clicks just to run a test and another 5 clicks to see what failed. Dave gave me funny 
  looks when I complained about this but I couldn’t believe people programmed this way. Later 
  my dad, remembering a demo by Kent Beck, reassured me that there are keyboard shortcuts 
  for everything. Thank goodness!
</p>

<p>
  In general it’s a sweet language. Experience with Ruby and Objective C exposed me to many 
  of the concepts so there weren’t many surprises. Perhaps the most peculiar thing I ran into 
  was the Smalltalk equivalent to if/else statements. The ”ifTrue: ifFalse:” structure makes 
  perfect sense but it was unexpected. An example can be seen in the ”score” method.
</p>  

<p>
  This is my first Smalltalk program and I’m sure I’ve made some newbie blunders. Feel free 
  to rip my code to pieces in your comments. I’d love to hear advise and learn Smalltalk 
  idiosyncrasies.
