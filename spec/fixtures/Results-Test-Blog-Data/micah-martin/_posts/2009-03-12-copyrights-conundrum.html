title: Copyrights Conundrum
tag:
---


<p>
  Here’s the situation. You’ve spent days working on an open source project. 
  Your sweat, blood, and tears have been poured into thousands of lines of code 
  spread through countless file in a sprawling tree of directories. The final 
  step is to release your masterpiece into the wild. So you choose your open source 
  license and then it hits you; you realize that need to add a copyright header to 
  EACH and EVERY source code files. How tedious! You google for a tool that will 
  automatically add the headers for you, and you find nothing satisfactory. In the 
  end, you write your own script to add the headers for you.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve been in this exact situation and written such a script too many times. 
  My most recent experience and script implementation will be the last. I’ve dubbed 
  this last imeplementation 
  <a href="https://github.com/slagyr/mmcopyrights">MM Copyrights</a> 
  and you’re welcome to use it.
</p>

<p>
  MM Copyrights is a simple Ruby gem that will search a directory for source code 
  files, inserting or updating a header comment in each file.
</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

It’s just a matter of installing the gem hosted on Github.

<!--
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install slagyr-mmcopyrights
-->

<p>
  Update: The github shenanigans is not longer needed. To install, simply:
</p>

<!--
sudo gem install mmcopyrights
-->

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
  Let’s say you want to add the following copyright header to all .rb files in 
  the lib directory…
</p>

<!--
require 'mmcopyrights'
MM::Copyrights.process("lib", "rb", "#-", "©2009 Micah Martin\nAll rights reserved")
-->

<p>
  And all the ruby files will look like this:
</p>

<!--
#- ©2009 Micah Martin
#- All rights reserved

... ruby code ...
-->

<p>
  Typically I keep the copyright text in a separate file and write the following 
  Rake task…
</p>

<!--
task :copyrights do
    require 'mmcopyrights'
    MM::Copyrights.process('lib', "rb", "#-", IO.read('copyrights.txt'))
end
-->

<p>
  or the following ant task if need be…
</p>

<!--
<target name="copyrights">
    <exec command="ruby">
        <arg value="-rrubygems" />
        <arg value="-e" />
        <arg value="require 'mmcopyrights'; MM::Copyrights.process('src', 'java', 
        '//-', IO.read('copyright.txt'))" />
    </exec>
</target>
-->

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
  If you haven’t guessed, <code>MM::Copyrights::process</code> takes 4 parameters.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The path of the directory containing source code.<li>
  <li>The extension of source file to be processed.</li>
  <li>The comment prefix. Note that there’s an extra -. This is because we want the 
    copyright comments to be unique from all other comments. The tool will search 
    for this unique prefix to find existing copyright headers.</li>  
  <li>The copyright text, without the comment prefix.</li>
</ol>

<p>  
  That’s about it. Feel free to run <code>MM::Copyrights::process</code> multiple 
  times on the same code base. It’s harmless. And when the new year rolls around, 
  just change the copyright text and rerun the tool. It will update existing headers.
