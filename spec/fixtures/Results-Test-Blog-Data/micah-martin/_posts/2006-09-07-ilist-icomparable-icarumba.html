title: IList, IComparable, ICarumba!

<p>
  This <i>IConvention</i> is an interesting one. <i>“Let’s prefix all interfaces with a capital I.”</i> 
  Who thought of this? Why did they think it was a good idea?
</p>  

<p>
  Let’s say I want to implement the Command pattern in C#. I create the following interface…. and to be 
  true the fathers of C# I use the IConvention.
</p>  

<!--
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
} 
-->

<p>
  In my application I can now write Code like this.
</p>

<!--
public void ExecuteCommands(IList commands)
{
    foreach(ICommand command in commands)
        command.Execute();
}
-->

<p>
  Clearly, every object in the IList of commands is an Implementation of <b>ICommand</b>. And <b>ICommand</b> 
  is an Interface because It starts with an I. That’s Important to know because If It didn’t have the I, It 
  might be an abstract class or even a concrete class. And If that were the case then….. well…. hmmm…. it 
  doesn’t really matter. I could call the class <b>ICommand</b> or I could call it <b>Command</b>. From the 
  point of view of the client code, maybe <b>Command</b> it’s an interface or maybe it’s not. So if it’s all 
  the same, I might as well submit to the convention and call it <b>ICommand</b>. Right?
</p>

<p>
  <b>Wrong!</b> Prefixing interfaces with I is a mistake and this is why….
</p>

<p>
  Assume that I really do need a <i>Command</i> abstraction. Should it be an interface or an abstract class? 
  I can’t think of any logic to put in the base class and the Dependancy Inversion Principles says interfaces 
  are preferred. So I’ll make it an interface and follow the IConvention naming it <b>ICommand</b>. After a 
  while there are a dozen or so implementations of <b>ICommand</b> in the application. New implementations are 
  popping up all the time. One day I realize that the application needs to know whether an <b>ICommand</b> has 
  executed or not. Since this affects all implementations of <b>ICommand</b> I can add another method to the 
  interface:
</p>

<!--
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
    bool Executed { get; }
} 
-->

<p>
  However, it’s not long before I realize that all the derived classes implement the <b>Executed</b> property 
  with the exact same code. They also need a boolean field. So to avoid duplicate code, I’ll use Template Method 
  like so:
</p>

<!--
public abstract class ICommand
{
    private bool hasExecuted = false;

    public virtual Execute()
    {
        PerformExecution();
        hasExecuted = true;
    }

    protected abstract PerformExecution();

    public bool Executed
    {
        get { return hasExecuted; }
    }
}
-->

<p>
  But wait! <b>ICommand</b> is not longer an interface. I can’t just leave that I sitting there. Clients will think 
  it’s still an interface. So now I need to rename the class to <b>Command</b> without the I. Fortunately, !-ReSharper-! 
  will help me there. But now I’ve got the <b>Command</b> class in a file named <i>ICommand.cs</i>. Renaming the file is 
  a bit more challenging since it has to be changed in source control as well. So I rename the file in the subversion 
  repository, then remove the <i>ICommand.cs</i> file from the Visual Studio project, and finally add the new <i>Command.cs</i> 
  file to the project…. whew. That silly I sure causes a good deal of hurt.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve stumble over this scenario more times than I care to mention. Experience has taught me that prefixing interfaces 
  with an I is a choice that will come back and haunt me. So I don’t do it.
</p>  

<p>
  Here’s my dilema. Maybe you can help me. I’ve been translating Unclebob’s <b>Agile Software Development</b> book into C#. 
  In the code examples I have heeded my experience and created interfaces without the I prefix. Reviewers don’t like this. 
  They keep telling me that I need to add the I prefix. I’m torn. I feel in my heart of hearts that using the IConvention does 
  more harm than good. Yet, readers of the book will be familiar with the IConvention and may be confused by examples that 
  don’t use it. What’s the right thing to do?
