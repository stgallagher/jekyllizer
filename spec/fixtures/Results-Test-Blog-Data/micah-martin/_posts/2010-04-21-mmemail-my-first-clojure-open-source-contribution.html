title: MMEmail: My First Clojure Open Source Contribution

<p>
  While working on 
  <a href="http://potterycat.com/">website for my sister</a>, 
  I was perturbed that there were no libraries on 
  <a href="http://clojars.org/">Clojars</a> 
  for sending email. I was using 
  <a href="http://nakkaya.com/2009/11/10/using-java-mail-api-from-clojure/">Leiningen</a> 
  which will download and include all your dependancies for you (so sweet!). Yet, with the 
  <a href="http://nakkaya.com/2009/11/10/using-java-mail-api-from-clojure/">library I found</a>
  , I had to manually download all the required jars. Call me lazy but being forced to manually 
  download dependancies seems like cruel and unusual punishment these days.
</p>

<p>
  So I solved the problem:
</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/slagyr/mmemail">MMEmail</a></h3>

<p>
  Simple Clojure library for sending email, with just one jar!
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<h4>Leiningan:</h4>

<!-->
(defproject your-project "0.0.0"
  :dependencies [[mmemail "1.0.0"]]
-->

<h4>Jar File</h4>

<p>
  …can be downloaded at http://clojars.org/repo/mmemail/mmemail/1.0.0/mmemail-1.0.0.jar
</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<h4>Include the library</h4>

<!--
(use 'mmemail.core)
-->

<h4>The Easy Way</h4>

<p>
  <code>mmemail.core</code> is the only include you need. It contains only 2 methods, the 
  fist being send-email. It takes a map that includes all the configuration and email 
  parameters. That’s it.
</p>

<!--
(send-email {:host "smtp.gmail.com" 
             :port 465 
             :ssl true 
             :user "road@gmail.com" 
             :password "runner" 
             :to "joe@acme.com" 
             :subject "Greetings" 
             :body "Meep Meep!"})
-->

<p>
  Most of the parameters are required, but based on your server configuration you might 
  get away without these:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>:ssl</li>
  <li>:password</li>
  <li>:subject</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It also accepts the following optional parameters:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>:from (defaults to :user)</li>
  <li>:cc</li>
  <li>:bcc</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The recipient parameters (:to, :cc, :bcc) may be a string, for one recipient, or a sequence 
  of strings, for multiple recipients.
</p>

<h4>The Convenient Way</h4>

<p>
  It can be annoying to pass such a big map into the function, and typically you’ll want to get 
  all the server configuration out of the way. This is where the second function of <code>mmemail.core 
  (create-mailer)</code> comes into play.
</p>  

<!--
(def my_mailer (create-mailer {:host "smtp.gmail.com"
                               :port 465
                               :ssl true
                               :user "road@gmail.com"
                               :password "runner"}))
-->                             

<p>                              
  <code>create-mailer</code> will return a new function with all the configuration baked in. 
  So in the future, you can send email like so:
</p>  

<!--
 (my_mailer {:to "joe@acme.com"
             :subject "Greetings"
             :body "Meep Meep!"})
-->

<p>
  The <code>create-mailer</code> accepts email parameters that will be used as defaults 
  when the generated function is called.
</p>

<!--
(def my_mailer (create-mailer {:subject "Greetings"
                               :body "Meep Meep!"
                               :host "smtp.gmail.com"
                               :port 465
                               :ssl true
                               :user "road@gmail.com"
                               :password "runner"}))
(my_mailer {:to "joe@acme.com"})
-->
