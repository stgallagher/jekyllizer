  As craftsmen, we're proud of our work. Yet it's rare that we get the opportunity 
  to show off what we do for clients. Fortunately the kind folks at Fidelity Life 
  have given us permission to do just that. Check out the case study summarizing 
  several systems 8th Light built for Fidelity Life using mostly Ruby and Rails. This 
  project is a whopper.
