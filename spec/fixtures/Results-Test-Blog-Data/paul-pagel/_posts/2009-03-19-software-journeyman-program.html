title: Software Journeyman program

<h2>
  8th Light and Obtiva have partnered up to provide a journeyman program.  Traditionally, 
  a journeyman program is when a master craftsman hires a journeyman for a specific 
  project.  This journeyman lives and works with the master, learning from her/his 
  experience and helping the master produce craftwork.  A lot has changed since this 
  type of journeyman program was prevalent.

  We are going to have to alter the journeyman idea to fit into the way that both companies 
  do business.

  Our program is the first software journeyman program that I know of.  It consists of 
  sending a craftsman to the another company for a specific amount of time.  It is 
  exciting to have the opportunity to travel to another workshop and gain new experiences.  
  Being the first of its kind, it is hard to set hard goals.  I hope among them are the 
  ability to see how a different style and thought process goes into software craftsmanship 
  at different workshop.  As a journeyman, I think it is important to be very diverse in 
  skills and techniques, so you can use the ones which best fit your coding style and 
  problem sets.

  Our solidarity with Obtiva on the topic of craftsmanship provided a willingness to work 
  together to make the program work in today's business environment.

  So, how did this happen?  Corey Haines has been traveling the countryside on his own 
  journeyman tour, dropping apple seeds.  One of those seeds was getting 8th Light and 
  Obtiva together in a room to hammer out solutions to all the obstacles involved in 
  starting a cooperative journeyman program.  I am very thankful to Corey for being 
  proactive in putting it together.
