  <b>1 - &ldquo;The list of SCNA presenters reads like Whoâ€™s Who of Software Jedi 
  Knighthood&rdquo; -- Ray Hightower </b>
</p>
<p>
  This is a complete testament to how willing and excited the thought leaders and 
  software masters were to speak at this conference.  The creme of the crop in software 
  mastery will be talking about how to raise the bar in our industry.  I have never 
  seen a lineup of speakers who put me in such a state of awe since the early XP 
  Universe days.  Thanks to all of them for getting together for this conference.

  <b>2 - Join software craftsmanship over crap.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Last year Uncle Bob challenged software developers to become professionals.  We have 
  spent a year of summits, manifestos, meet ups, and conferences trying to figure out 
  how to move forward towards professionalism with this paradigm of software 
  craftsmanship.  The momentum of craftsmanship is only growing.

  <b>3 - Software craftsmen all in one room.</b>
</p>
<p>
  The google map of software craftsman who have signed the software craftsmanship 
  manifesto has proven this to be a global community of software developers.  It is 
  unique that we have people flying in from multiple continents to participate.  I am 
  excited to meet face to face with all these craftsmen whom I know only their ideas 
  and email addresses.

  <b>4 - Richard Sennett</b>
</p>
<p>
  A sociologist who wrote The Craftsman, Dr. Sennett has provided a template for 
  studying the habits and techniques of craftsmanship.  He touches on everything from 
  extending your concentration to why we choose vocations so passionately.  It is a 
  true authority on craftsmanship.
