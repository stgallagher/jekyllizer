  Good design sense is a skill that comes only from many years of coding experience. 
  Sometimes it can be very difficult to make those design decisions when you are an 
  apprentice or otherwise don’t have much experience.
</h2>  
<p>
  When I was an apprentice, oftentimes I would get a problem from Micah (my mentor) 
  and would solve it the simplest way possible. Then I would walk up to him with my 
  head held high and say I was done.  He would almost always point out some way the 
  architecture was not easy to extend or that he didn’t even know java had goto 
  statements.  
</p>
<p>
  As an apprentice, the most important thing is to get everything to work correctly; 
  only then should you concentrate on making sure it is good code.  Writing great code 
  with great designs is not a skill that will appear overnight.  It took years of 
  honing my design sense to be able to see designs right away, and I have only scratched 
  the surface of my mentor’s abilities. 
</p>
<p>
  When I was an apprentice, I lacked the experience and skill to make difficult 
  architectural choices.  Let alone the ability to get it right on the first pass.  
  I instead stayed close to the code and continued to move forward writing working code.  
  This led to many design mistakes, and I had to throw out plenty of code or refactor to 
  a better design.  This is an exercise in taking a step backwards to move forwards. I 
  learned the value of working code as well as the value of refactoring to better 
  designs.  Content before form is an important lesson I learned as an apprentice.  It 
  laid the foundation for the later lesson that good form is essential for high quality 
  code.
</p>
<p>
  As an apprentice, ask your mentor when you have completed a task if they think there is 
  a better design.  Then refactor that design and compare the two.  Once again, repetition 
  and practice will pay off as these exercises help you develop a matured design sense.  
  You will learn from having to solve the problem without being told the design first, and 
  then later having to re-implement a better design.  This practice will internalize your 
  design sense and eventually you will start to see the better designs the first time 
  through.
</p>
<p>
  The big problem with trying to get the design right the first time is it leads to coders 
  block.  Staring at the blank screen, trying to figure out the best way to do something.  
  Even if you are writing the wrong code, it is important to be moving in some direction.  
  When I see the code, oftentimes the design I get will form around the reading of the code 
  rather than trying to think in the abstract about the whole problem at once.  For me the 
  problem and the design for the solution would be too big of a mental model to fit in my 
  head all at once.  Don’t worry, as you get more experience, your mental context will expand 
  too.  Your ability to sustain concentration will build as well as you practice and become 
  more experienced.  With experience, you won’t have to think about as many of the small 
  problems anymore.

  Architecture is like most craftsman practices in the sense that there are breakthroughs 
  but there is always more to learn.  I read a 
  <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/04/25/the-scatology-of-agile-architecture"> blog</a> 
  recently where Uncle Bob Martin talks about thinking through the architecture of a problem 
  for hours or days before he will start.  When I was an apprentice, I would not have had 
  enough experience or a large enough mental model to think about the architectural impact 
  of a solution.  Even as a journeyman, I still only have a big enough mental model to think 
  about an aspect of a problem, write the code, then reevaluate where the solution stands in 
  the context of the system.
</p>
<p>
  For an apprentice, bad design should not be seen as the end of the world.  As long as you 
  are learning and progressing in the techniques of creating working code, you are moving in 
  the right direction.  Design sense is a long-term skill and you will have to be patient 
  with it.  Remember that practice makes perfect.
