title: Active Record migration dependencies
tag:
---


<p>
	We had a new developer join our project recently, and he needed his computer to be setup 
	with the project. “Here is the svn repository, when you check it out, run these rake tasks.” 
	It unfortunately, is never that easy. This project setup revealed something about Active 
	Record and migrations that I didn’t know about.
</p>
<p>
	When I create a migration, I will often do data manipulation on the database, or pre-populate 
	some fields with data needed for a lookup table. Lets look at a sample migration from a trivia 
	game.
</p>
<!-- 
class CreateQuestions < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def self.up

    create_table :questions do |t|
      t.column :text, :string
      t.column :answer, :string
      t.timestamps
    end

    Question.populate
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :questions
  end
end 
-->
<p>
	I want to add some sample questions, so that even if you don’t have your own questions, you 
	will still be able to play the game. I added the method to the populate model, because I use 
	it elsewhere in the code, and I try to keep it DRY. The populate method on the question model 
	looks like this:
</p>
<!-- 
class Question < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :game
  has_many :answers

  def self.populate
    Questions.create(:name => "What is your favorite color?", :answer => "I don't know")
    Questions.create(:name => "Who was the first President", :answer => "George Washington")
    Questions.create(:name => "Who was born Samuel Clemens?", :answer => "Mark Twain")
  end

end 
-->
<p>
	So, later on, I decided to add a degree of difficulty to the questions, so the players can get 
	more points for answering harder questions. Here is what the migration looked like.
</p>
<!-- 
class CreateQuestions < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def self.up
    add_column :questions, :rank, :integer
    Question.destroy_all #In case there are any old ones
    Question.populate
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :questions, :rank
  end
end 
-->
<p>
	Of which I had to change the populate method on the question class to:
</p>
<!-- 
class Question < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :game
  has_many :answers

  def self.populate
    Questions.create(:name => "What is your favorite color?", :answer => "I don't know", :rank => 1)
    Questions.create(:name => "Who was the first President", :answer => "George Washington", :rank => 3)
    Questions.create(:name => "Who was born Samuel Clemens?", :answer => "Mark Twain", :rank => 8)
  end

end 
-->
<p>
	Then I ran my migrations, and continued development. Then when developer number 2 came across and 
	checked out the project and ran the migrations, he got the error.
</p>
<p>
	undefined method rank= for class Question (…or something very similar)
</p>
<p>
	The problem is the old migration is dependent on the new model. All models in rails are just a mirror 
	of the database, so the new model has a forward definition of the data. The code in the model knows 
	about the rank field, but the schema of the database hasn’t caught up to create that portion of the 
	mirror yet. This creates a little bit of a catch 22. The rails wiki 
	(http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations) about migrations tells you to redefine the 
	class to stop name conflicts. This would require me to make my migrations model agnostic, inserting 
	straight to the database. As a spoiled brat when it comes to databases and rails, I refuse to let go 
	of my Active Record sugary syntax. Another solution I thought of is to just make the last change to 
	question do the populate, and remove it from the previous versions. This will become a maintenance 
	nightmare.
</p>
<p>
	I came to the realization that I want to make a distinction between form and content when it comes 
	to migrations. Form in this case is schema form, the changes to the database which reflect the data 
	which the Active Records can potential hold. Content is the specific data which is in the database. 
	This distinction allows for me to use the power of my model classes in my data migrations, which is 
	the place it is useful. It maintains backwards compatibility, because before I go touching the data, 
	I have to make sure my schema is right.
</p>
<p>
	What does this look like in Rails? I am not sure yet. Possibly db/migrations/schema and db/migrations/data. 
	Possible saving the data migrations in each migration as a block and executing those at the end, only when 
	you have the schema is correct. I am going to try it out!
