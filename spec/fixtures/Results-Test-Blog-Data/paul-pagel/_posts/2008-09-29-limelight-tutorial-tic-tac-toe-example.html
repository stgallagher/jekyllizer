<h2>
  Welcome to a Limelight production. I am going to go through a step by step introduction 
  to limelight development using a tic tac toe game as an example. So, lets get started. 
  I am going to create the directory structure and open it up in a text editor. 
</h2>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-1.sh"></script>
<p>
  Now I need to set up Limelight. You can just download the gem.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-2.sh"></script>
<p>
  We can start by creating the props.rb file in the tictactoe directory. The props.rb 
  file defines the structure of your application. A prop is named after the theater 
  metaphor. We are going to use them to define what our scene's physical structure look 
  like. We can start with a simple screen with an empty board with the nine cells we need 
  for a tic tac toe game. Lets create a spec directory to write a test for the props we 
  are going to create.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-3.sh"></script>
<p>
  Now for the spec.  In the spec directory, we can name our spec props_spec.rb.  We want 
  to check that there is a cell on the scene.  Here is the first test.  NOTE: To be able 
  to run the test, you will need the spec_helper.rb in your spec directory (not the props 
  directory).  You can copy it from the 
  <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/files/tictac.zip">sample application</a>.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-4.rb"></script>
<p>
  and when we run it (You can copy the Rakefile from the sample application as well, if you want to have a specs task), 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-5.sh"></script>
<p>
  we get the failure 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-6.txt"></script>
<p>
  So, lets create the props.rb file in the project root. Now we should get the error. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-7.txt"></script>
<p>
  Each of the props accepts a block of code your can give options/structure to. We can 
  open the props.rb file and add a cell with the id of &ldquo;cell_0_0&rdquo; to make this 
  test pass. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-8.txt"></script>
<p>
  And the test passes. Lets make sure we have the rest of the id's while we are at it. Here 
  is a more exhaustive spec. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054198.js?file=ppagel-20080929-9.txt"></script>
<p>
  And it fails in a similar manner. Lets expand our props.rb file to make the test pass. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-10.rb"></script>
<p>
  And it passes. However, it is all ruby code, so I can leverage ruby functions to help me 
  out. Lets remove the duplication. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-11.rb"></script>
<p>
  Much better. Lets now move on to the styles. Nothing will show up without a few styles. 
  I create a styles.rb file in the project root and filled it with some simple content. In 
  Limelight, styles refer to how a prop is aesthetically displayed on the screen. Here is an 
  example which defines the size and gives a border to the board and the cells. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-12.rb"></script>
<p>
  We should be able to start up Limelight and see the board. We start Limelight like: (From 
  the tictacctoe directory) 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-13.sh"></script>
<p>
  and there is your first Limelight screen.  Pretty easy, and all ruby code.  Lets make it 
  more interesting.  Let us make it such that if you click on one of the squares, the square 
  shows the 'X' mark denoting the first move.
</p>
<p>
  First we create a directory called players.  Inside go the players, which contain the 
  actions and behavior of the props for a Limelight scene (the controllers).
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-14.sh"></script>
<p>
  We want to now make a player for the cell prop. We create a file inside of the players 
  directory called cell.rb. The file will start with a definition by looking like: 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-15.rb"></script>
<p>
  We define all players in modules of the same name as the file and prop, by convention.  
  This allows Limelight to include this behavior when it needs it.  You can specify specific 
  mappings between the props and its players, but we don't need to do that here.  So, let's 
  make the cell more interesting.  When we click on the cell, we want it to make a large 'X' 
  mark.  Lets start by creating a spec for the behavior.
</p>
<p>
  I created a new directory for the players spec
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-16.rb"></script>
<p>
  We have to add the players directory to the ruby search path, so I added the following 
  line to the spec_helper. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-17.rb"></script>
<p>
  My spec is going to find the prop that was clicked on and make that prop display an 'X', 
  denoting the first move. Here is what my first spec looks like (I call it cell_spec.rb): 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054205.js?file=ppagel-20080929-18.rb"></script>
<p>
  Which provides the feedback when run:
</p> 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-19.sh"></script>
<p>
  If you have seen a rSpec specification before, this should look syntactically familiar.  
  Before we move on to making the test pass, let us take closer look at a few aspects.  
</p>
<p>
  @id = "cell_1_1" - This line is setting the id of the imaginary prop that the players 
  behavior will be executed against.
  <br />
  @scene = MockScene.new - This creates a scene to mock out.  The scene will be explained 
  later, but for this test we are going to use the find method on scene to find our props.
  <br />
  @cell_one = MockProp.new - Create a mock prop that will turn to 'X' when clicked
  <br />
  @scene.register("cell_1_1", @cell_one) - We are giving the scene the mock prop, so the 
  find method will find it by its id.
  <br />
  mouse_clicked(nil) - Simulates a mouse_click on the cell.  It takes an event, but we 
  don't care about that yet, so lets just pass in nil.
</p>
<p>
All right, time to make this test pass.  Lets open up the cell.rb player and see what we 
need done to make the test pass.  
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-20.rb"></script>
<p>
  Run the test again, no failures. We needed to find the prop on the screen which we are 
  concerned about.  We do this by calling find on a method scene, which will give us any 
  prop by its unique identifier.  We are looking for the id of the element we clicked, 
  and then we set the text of that element to 'X', which makes the test satisfied.
</p>
<p>
  Now, we can run the application from the root directory.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-21.sh"></script>
<p>
  If we click on the box that is displayed, a small 'X' should appear in the upper right 
  corner.  
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations, that is your first piece of Limelight behavior.  However, this is not 
  very interesting yet.  Lets take it the next step and make the tic tac toe game work.  
  I am going to create a lib directory to hold the game model.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-22.sh"></script>
<p>
  And before I write my first spec, I am going to add the new lib directory to the ruby 
  search path by adding the following line to the spec_helper (It is already in the 
  example spec_helper.rb, you don't need to add it).
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-23.rb"></script>
<p>
  So, here is what my first spec looks like: 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-24.rb"></script>
<p>
  To make it pass, we need to create a game class in the lib directory and give it this 
  code. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-25.rb"></script>
<p>
  And we can follow the test driving of the model to make the game class.  I have already 
  done this, and you can download the models in the 
  <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/files/tictac.zip">sample application</a>.  Lets move 
  past that back to the players and hook up the game.
</p>
<p>
  I am going to create a file init.rb in the root directory.  The init.rb class gets loaded 
  up by Limelight when you start the application.  We want to create a new game and have a 
  way to keep it in memory for the other classes to use.  Here is what the spec looks like 
  in a init_spec.rb in the spec directory:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-26.rb"></script>
<p>
  The simplest way to start that is to have a current_game class variable. Here is the code 
  for the init.rb.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054208.js?file=ppagel-20080929-27.rb"></script>
<p>
  I add the lib directory to the ruby search path so the Limelight application would know 
  what a game is when I require it.
</p>
<p>
  Now we need to plug the game model into the cell player.  Lets change the spec we made 
  earlier to make the first move depending on the game model.  Here is the new version.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-28.rb"></script>
<p>
  I am mocking out the game model and passing the values from the id into the game's move 
  method. Here is the code that makes this pass. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-29.rb"></script>
<p>
  Minus the ugly string manipulation, it is a pretty straight forward approach. Now we 
  should be able to start up the application and click on any of the squares and make some 
  moves. There are 2 things left to do for this demo. We need to make sure that a player 
  can not move on a square that is already occupied, and we need to display a winner. So 
  for the first task, we need to write a spec to have some kind of feedback to the players 
  that the move is invalid. Let's add this spec to the props_spec file. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-30.rb"></script>
<p>
  Nice and simple. Here is the new props.rb file. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-31.rb"></script>
<p>
  Now lets write a spec for the cell_spec to make sure that the move is valid, else we 
  display a message in the message center to the user they must move somewhere else. Here 
  is the spec. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-32.rb"></script>
<p>
  Same as before, with a new prop added. Here is the new cell.rb file. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-33.rb"></script>
<p>
  Simple if, makes it all work. Lets remove the duplication in the specs. Here is the 
  new spec file. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-34.rb"></script>
<p>
  Much better. Now lets do the case of a winner. Here is the spec for the cell. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-35.rb"></script>
<p>
  And here is the new cell.rb 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054218.js?file=ppagel-20080929-36.rb"></script>
<p>
  Now we can finish off the application by adding new game functionality, or even a 
  computer player that can not be beaten! However, before I let you go, we have to add 
  some styles to the message center and pretty up the board to make it look better. To 
  find a comprehensive list of the styles supported in Limelight, go here
  (http://limelightwiki.8thlight.com/index.php/Style_Attributes). Here is a new version 
  of the styles.rb. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054219.js?file=ppagel-20080929-37.rb"></script>
<p>
  There was one change to the props.rb file, to wrap the message_center in a prop called 
  message_center_container.  Also, notice the pretty rounded corners.  Easy to do.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the props.rb
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054219.js?file=ppagel-20080929-38.rb"></script>
<p>
  Happy Limelight coding!
