title: Rails Migrations and Subversion

<p>In rails, migrations are generated like so</p>
<p>
	<code>paul-pagels-computer:~/RailsProjects/project paulpagel$ ruby script/generate migration 
		CreatePacketTimestamp exists db/migrate create db/migrate/013createpacket_timestamp.rb
	</code>	
</p>
<p>
	This creates a numbered migration with an up and a down schema direction. This has been 
	incredibly helpful when dealing with the schema changes. The problem our team has found is 
	doing migrations with subversion.
</p>
<p>
	You run migrations by
</p>
<p>
	<code>paul-pagels-computer:~/RailsProjects/project paulpagel$ rake migrate</code>
</p>	
<p>
	Which looks in the schema_info table to find which version of the schema your database is 
	representing, and updates it to the most recent version (the highest number).
</p>
<p>
	The problem comes into play when you have multiple people making migration scripts on their 
	local machine at the same time. If two different people did a migration at the same time and 
	committed them you would end up with two migrations. Which one gets run?
</p>
<p>
	I am not sure how to solve this one yet. I have been loving rails, but this has already 
	has put a dampener on it.
