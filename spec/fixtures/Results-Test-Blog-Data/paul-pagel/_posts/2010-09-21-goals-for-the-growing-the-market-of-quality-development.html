title: Goals for the growing the market of quality development
tag:

<h2>
  Many small software contracting companies are popping up in the last few years, 8th 
  Light being among them.  Their fundamental value is the same, that software development 
  can be better than it is currently done in IT departments across the globe.  They also 
  wouldn’t be successful if there wasn’t a market for high quality, expensive software.  
  I hope that this direction does a few things:
</h2>
<h3>I hope it sets standards for the software industry.</h3>  
<p>
  Raises the bar to rid ourselves with the staggering project failure rates.  Or at least 
  make the transparency between good code and bad code widely accessible.  It should be 
  transparent to the customer if they are getting the amish furniture or college dorm 
  furniture. 
</p>
<h3>I hope it shows us how to teach software.</h3>  
<p>
  Computer Science departments in academia are important, but are so disconnected with how 
  software is actually written.  Pair programming, 
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>, and design patterns should all be 
  taught before someone gets a professional software development gig.  Software is a craft 
  skill which requires a theoretical background.  Doing is as important as knowing and 
  both are required.
</p>
<h3>I hope it shows us the tight feedback loop between software and business.</h3>  
<p>
  With many software developers joining smaller companies, the involvement in business has 
  risen.  Like many other professions;  writers, marketers, and salesmen, software craftsmen 
  need to understand the core business value of the software itself.  Is this software 
  application cost-saving?  Revenue-generating?  What is the relationship between the 
  feature(s) I am writing and the value to the organization?
</p>
<h3>I hope it makes us lots of money.</h3>   
<p>
  There are many craft professions which have had their time in the market spotlight, and 
  many which may not ever have a time in the spotlight.  Software is needed in all forms 
  right now, and as craftsmen we should take advantage of our skill set during this time in 
  history to do a good job and receive good compensation.  Soon enough the world will move 
  on to robots writing software, and we will be doing it for pennies.
</p>
<p>
  Software craftsmanship has its spotlight now and I hope we use it to mature our industry.
