<h2>
  8th Light has always had an open door policy towards developers.  When anyone has asked 
  to come hang out at 8th Light offices, we donâ€™t turn anyone away.  We also invite 
  developers to come in and pair with us.  It has been a fun practice to get to know other 
  developers here in Chicago as well as developers traveling through town.  We would like 
  to flip that practice around and invite anyone interested in pairing with 8th Lighters 
  or just coming in to hang out.
</h2>
<p>
  Every Friday we have a noon lunch and learn (lunch provided by 8th Light) and then we 
  will be available to pair for the afternoon.  Want to come in and see how we work?  
  Learn to use Limelight?  Teach us something cool?  Just hang out with cool developers?

  Please RSVP with me (paul [at] our domain name) so we know how much food to order.
