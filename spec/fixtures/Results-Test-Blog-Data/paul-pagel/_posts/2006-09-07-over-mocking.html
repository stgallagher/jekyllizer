title: Over Mocking

<p>
	I have noticed using more mocks lately. Instead of using them sparingly for 
	controlling services which are not instrumental to what I am testing, I am 
	essentially using them as a way to isolated what I am testing. This has me 
	noticing a side effect I am not entirely comfortable with. To use the mock, 
	I need to be able to have the mock in the production code, which means I need 
	to inject an abstraction of the mock (dynamic mocks will do that for you).
</p>	
<p>
	So, the side effect is long parameter lists, specifically in constructors. 
	Everything takes almost all the objects it uses. Then, to create the production 
	objects are factories. I am using many more factories than I would without mass 
	mocking. I am not sure if this is a good use of dependency decoupling and factory 
	building as design techniques, or if this is a symptom of over design and tightly 
	coupling the mocks to the tests, making it more difficult to change the tests 
	without changing the interface the mock is implementing. Thoughts?
