title: Unrubify

<p>
	Often times while writing meta programming code, I am using the eval function and doing 
	manipulation on method/class/variable names. Today I needed to unrubify a name. I havenâ€™t 
	seen this done regularly, and unfortunately there is no fun rails method to do it (there 
	is one for rubifying a string). So, here is my attempt at it, for anyone trying to solve 
	the same problem.

<!--
def unrubify(sentence)  
  sentence.capitalize!
  sentence.gsub!(/_(.)/) { $1.upcase }
  return sentence 
end
-->

	Any suggestions on improvements please let me know!
