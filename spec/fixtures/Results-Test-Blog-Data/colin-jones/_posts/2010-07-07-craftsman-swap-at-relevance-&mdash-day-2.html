title: Craftsman Swap at Relevance &mdash; Day 2
tag:
---

<h2>
  Today was my second at Relevance for our craftsmanship swap. 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/redinger">Chris</a> and I continued work on
  the project from yesterday.
</h2>
<p>
  I was glad to have a chance to continue the story work we'd started, and see
  it through to completion by this afternoon, eliminating a few timezone bugs 
  along the way (I'll get back to that).
</p>
<p>
  We started the morning off with the company-wide stand-up meeting again, followed 
  by a retrospective for the project I was pairing on. Chris explained that every 
  iteration on a given project, Relevance does either a retrospective or a risk 
  assessment meeting.
</p>
<p>
  After some scheduling and telephone difficulties on the client's side were (mostly)
  sorted out, <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph">Jason</a> kicked us off as the
  retrospective facilitator. I haven't been on a project that held retrospectives on a
  regular basis before (though we've certainly done them at times), so it was interesting
  to see the very structured approach Relevance takes. 
</p>
<p>
  As a brief outline, the team (and customers) began by outlining their expectations and
  hopes for the retrospective, followed by ratings of how several areas of the project
  (communication, ROI, building the right thing, etc.) were going, and finally a review
  and a set of action items with due dates attached. 
</p>
<p>
   The team members&mdash;Chris, Jason, <a href="http://twitter.com/donmullen">Don Mullen</a>,
  and <a href="http://twitter.com/parenteau">Michael Parenteau</a>&mdash;were all excellent
  at interacting with the customers. I like to think that I'm pretty good at that kind of
  interaction, but there's a lot I picked up in a short time on that conference call. 
</p>
<p>
  I heard a lot of rephrasing the customer's concerns to verify that the team always had the
  correct interpretation, and I'm sure the customer came away feeling like their needs were
  really being addressed, especially with the clear action items to address any issues
  that came up.
</p>
<p>
  Michael's design work on this project, incidentally, is pretty killer and got rave reviews
  from both of the client representatives.
</p>
<p>
  In yesterday's installment, I neglected to mention the project management tool the teams use, 
  <a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management">Mingle</a>. It's
  a very nice tool, which looks to have a ton of features, but (unlike some other many-featured
  products I've used) manages to keep the interface very clean and simple. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure in what situations I'd feel compelled to switch to it over something nice 
  (and free) like Pivotal Tracker or Agile Zen, but it is an impressive piece of software 
  that I'm glad to have had a chance to take a look at.
</p>
<p>
  So&hellip; time zones. Every time I deal with them it's a mind-bending struggle to keep all
  the concerns in their proper place, and today was no exception. We had our Time.zone in Rails
  set to <abbr title="Universal Time Coordinated">UTC</abbr>, but were still getting some 
  <abbr title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</abbr> times.
</p>
<p>
  Well, it turns out things like Date.today.beginning_of_day don't respect that setting and use
  whatever the default system time zone is. After about an hour of investigations and pondering,
  we eventually decided to replace most uses of Date with the Rails TimeWithZone object,
  allowing some mildly unsavory naming with the understanding that the decision is going to need
  to be revisited to account for various user time zones anyway.
</p>
<p>
  It seems to me that this is a universal problem for apps that might be used in different time
  zones. Chris suggested that this might add to the often-quoted-but-rarely-sourced list of hard
  problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming* (and off-by-one errors?).
</p> 
<p>
  So henceforth, time zones are in there too. That's right, you heard it here first: it's three
  (or four, depending on if you're telling the off-by-one joke) hard problems: cache invalidation,
  naming, and time zones. 
</p>
<p>
  After work <a href="http://twitter.com/abedra">Aaron Bedra</a>, Alex Warr, 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/stuarthalloway">Stuart Halloway</a>, and 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/stuartsierra">Stuart Sierra</a> introduced me to my first draft-style
  game of Magic the Gathering. 
</p>
<p>
  Yes, that's right, I spent the evening with three of the Clojure/core guys and learned a ton&hellip;
  about Magic. It was fun&mdash;I got a ton of help from everybody, especially Alex and
  with a lot of help I actually won a few rounds. 
</p>
<p>
  We played duels, best-of-3, and I went 2-2 overall in games. And by &ldquo;I&rdquo;, I mostly mean
  &ldquo;the people who told me what I should put down.&rdquo; I heard a rumor on one end of the table
  that Relevance prefers to hire Magic players over non-players as programmers**, so potential
  applicants should take note.
</p>
<p>
  I don't know that I'll run out and buy a deck, but it's always fun to learn a new game, especially
  when the cards are named things like &ldquo;Lord of Shatterskull Pass&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
  Sounds like I'll be sitting in with <a href="http://twitter.com/alandipert">Alan Dipert</a>'s team 
  tomorrow on some Clojure work, which I'm very much looking forward to.
</p>

<p>* Some people on the Internet say the credit belongs to Phil Karlton, so it must be true.</p>

<p>** This sounds made up, and may be.</p>
