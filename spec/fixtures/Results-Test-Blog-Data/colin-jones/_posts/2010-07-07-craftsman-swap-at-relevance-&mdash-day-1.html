title: Craftsman Swap at Relevance &mdash; Day 1
tag:
---

<h2>
  I'm both honored and humbled to represent 8th Light on the latest 
  <a href="http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/post/80855433/craftsman-swap">Craftsmanship Swap</a>,
  with <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a> in Durham, NC.
</h2>
<p> 
  I'd first heard about Relevance through <a href="http://twitter.com/stuarthalloway">Stuart Halloway</a>'s
  excellent book 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Clojure-Pragmatic-Programmers-Halloway/dp/1934356336">Programming Clojure</a>,
  and their reputation precedes them in the Clojure community, as well as in the Ruby/Rails world. 
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph">Jason Rudolph</a> had me come in a few minutes
  early this morning to give me a quick introduction to the company before their company-wide
  standup, where the whole company gathered and very efficiently went through the interesting
  goings-on of the day. The plan for now is for me to spend a couple days working in Ruby/Rails,
  and a couple on Clojure&mdash;I'm excited about both.
</p>
<p>
  I paired up with <a href="http://twitter.com/redinger">Chris Redinger</a> to work on a Rails
  project that's just a few weeks old, but already doing some pretty cool stuff. There's a pretty
  slick graphing library on the project called <a href="http://highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>,
  which apparently even works on IE6 (gasp!). 
</p>
<p>
  We did some refactoring, which was a pleasure - Chris has a great eye (nose?) for code smells
  and writing excellent code (as well as customer relationships), and I often felt like we were
  on the same wavelength as we made improvements. We ran into a strange issue with the RSpec
  version we were on: models seem to be loaded twice during our spec runs, which gave us
  annoying errors about redefining constants (when we were most definitely only defining them once).
<p>
<p> 
  It turned out the right place for the (non-ActiveRecord) models was actually under <code>lib/</code>
  in this case, and that cleared up our problem. Chris thought this may have already been fixed in
  the latest RSpec 2 beta, but unfortunately we can't upgrade because newer versions are only
  compatible with Rails 3, which we're not using on this project. 
</p>
<p>
  We also got some feature work done, of course. The code is a pleasure to work in&mdash;clean, plenty
  of tests, and several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats">Thundercats</a> references,
  which is perhaps most important of all.
</p>
<p> 
  In all seriousness, it was pretty easy to jump in and contribute, and that's been due in large part
  to the high quality of the code. <a href="http://gembundler.com">Bundler</a>, by the way, seems awesome.
  I've heard mixed reviews, but my experience installing gems today was such a breeze that I'm definitely
  going to try to use it on my next Rails project. 
</p>
<p>
  I also sometimes forget how freeing it is to work on a project using Git&mdash;all of our
  greenfield projects use it, but I've gotten used to being on Subversion projects, where making a branch
  is a big production. Chris uses feature branches regularly, and they seem to work pretty well.
</p>
<p>
  The environment at Relevance is really nice - a big open space with lots of pairing stations, drinks
  and snacks, and even a keg of <a href="http://twitter.com/abedra">Aaron Bedra</a>'s delicious
  home-brewed Belgian-style wheat beer on tap.
</p>
<p>
  We had a great lunch of Thai food and very techy conversation - Node.js, Clojure, and EventMachine
  all got some playing time, and everyone agreed that Aquamacs was very pretty. Wait, maybe that
  last part went differently&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  After work, Aaron, his fiancee, <a href="http://twitter.com/stuartsierra">Stuart Sierra</a>,
  <a href="http://twitter.com/jdpace">Jared Pace</a> and I grabbed some Mexican food (after what
  was apparently a second failed attempt to eat at a place that serves something called a
  &ldquo;Defibralator&rdquo;&mdash;don't blame me, that's how they spell it on the online menu).
</p>
<p>
  Chris and I ended the day working on tracking down a data issue, which we hadn't completely 
  solved by the end of the day, but we narrowed the possible culprits down significantly, and 
  I'm sure it'll be obvious to us in the morning. Looking forward to tomorrow's adventures!
