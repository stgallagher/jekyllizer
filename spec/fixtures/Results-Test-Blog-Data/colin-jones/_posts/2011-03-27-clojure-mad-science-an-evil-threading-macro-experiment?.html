title: Clojure mad science (an evil threading macro experiment?)
tag:

<h2>
  <p>
    Let's say you're confronted with a problem like this one:
  </p>
  <p>
    You are a mad scientist, and you'd like to perform an experiment on your mysterious 
    test subjects. You want half of the subjects (chosen at random) to be assigned to 
    one of three experimental groups, and the other half of the subjects will serve as 
    the control group. The details of the experiments are not important for now, but 
    suffice to say they will not be condoned by the American Psychological Association.
  </p>
</h2>
<p>
  Got a solution already? OK, OK, we'll put this in more concrete, mathy terms, but 
  everything after this sentence is really part of a solution, so don't think you're 
  getting away with anything here, Doctor Scaryhausen.
</p>
<p>
  Given a collection of length n, shuffle the elements randomly, grab the odd ones, 
  and map those to values cycling among :x, :y, and :z. Don't forget to include the 
  even ones in your result map, mapped to :c (for the "control" group). [1]
</p>
<p>
  As a diligent student of Clojure's sequence library, you might come up with a solution 
  like this one:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-1.clj"></script>
<p>
  This works just fine, and as expected, you'll get a different result every time because 
  of the <code>shuffle</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-2.clj"></script>
<p>
  However, it's pretty hard to tell what's going on here. The duplication is pretty gross: 
  <code>(interleave (map last (filter (fn [[i subject]]</code>, and that contributes to a 
  feeling of just too many responsibilities for one function. It's hard to read and hard 
  to test, and that kind of thing makes the Wolfman, for one, pretty angry. Let's clean 
  that up.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-3.clj"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-4.clj"></script>
<p>
  Much better. In the process of removing the duplication, we've refactored out a function 
  <code>subject-groups</code> that has no knowledge of the algorithm we're using to split 
  up our subjects. That strategy gets injected as the function argument <code>pred</code>, 
  for &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;. Why not spell the whole word out? In short, because it's a 
  convention. In slightly less short, because if you've watched 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob Martin's</a> recent 
  <a href="http://www.cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-2/show">video on naming</a>, 
  you know that the convention itself is OK, because the scope of that binding is pretty 
  small.
</p>
<p>
  The other good thing about splitting these responsibilities out is that now 
  <code>subject-groups</code> and <code>assign-indexed-subjects</code>, the most complex 
  pieces of this solution, are now referentially transparent. They are deterministic, so they 
  can now be more easily understood, tested, and even memoized! It's generally a good idea to 
  partition side effects into small parts of a system in order to get these benefits.
</p>
<p>
  Now, because we have some time left before the sun sets and we're able to actually perform 
  our evil experiments, let's look more critically at <code>subject-groups</code>.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-5.clj"></script>
<p>
  For an experienced Lisper, this is relatively clear. Just four lines of implementation, 
  not too much cleverness, standard Clojure sequence functions. But what if we represented 
  this function in terms of the way the input <code>subjects</code> is transformed into a 
  map of subjects pointing to groups?
</p>
<p>
  If you've never seen Clojure's threading macros (<code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>), 
  then today's your lucky day! The idea is that you have a series of transformations, 
  represented by Clojure forms, inside the macro. And that macro takes the result of one 
  form and inserts it (in some way, depending on which macro) into the next form. As an 
  example, the <code>-&gt;</code> macro inserts into the second position (the first 
  argument):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-6.clj"></script>
<p>
  Using the <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> macro inserts into the last position:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-7.clj"></script>
<p>
  Pretty simple, right? One edge case is that a bare symbol, like <code>count</code>, 
  will be translated into <code>(count)</code> so that inserting into the form is 
  meaningful, but we won't need that detail here.
</p>
<p>
  So let's give this a shot with <code>subject-groups</code>. First, recall our current 
  implementation:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-8.clj"></script>
<p>
  Now let's use the <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> macro:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054755.js?file=cjones-20110327-9.clj"></script>
<p>
  Well crud. Do you see the problem? We'd like <code>(interleave (cycle groups))</code> 
  to be the next form (a transformer form?) to thread our data through, but that'll 
  give us a map keyed by group! This is because the previous form always gets stuck in 
  at the <em>end</em> of the next form with the <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> macro. At this 
  point, I've often used a cop-out, bailing out of one threading form and moving on with 
  a different one:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054783.js?file=cjones-20110327-10.clj"></script>
<p>
  Gah, it's starting to feel like Clojure is doing evil experiments on us! So now what? 
  Well, it seems we need to switch back to <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054783.js?file=cjones-20110327-11.clj"></script>
<p>
  OK, this gets the job done&hellip;
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054783.js?file=cjones-20110327-12.clj"></script>
<p>
  But are we really being clearer here than we were with our first version of <code>subject-groups</code>, without any threading macros? I'd argue that we're not, and I think it'd be tough to convince me otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Thankfully, there does exist a way to hack in the ordering we really want and use one threading macro the whole way down:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054783.js?file=cjones-20110327-13.clj"></script>
<p>
  This works as perfectly as Frankenstein's neck bolts!  Since we want our transforming 
  data to be the <em>first</em> argument to <code>interleave</code>, but the last argument 
  for the remainder of the transforming forms, we've just created an anonymous function 
  that's similar to <code>interleave</code>, but swaps the argument order. Recall here that 
  because we're using a macro (<code>-&gt;&gt;</code>), at runtime the code is nearly 
  identical to our initial <code>subject-groups</code> solution: the only difference is 
  this new swapped-argument <code>interleave</code>-like function that we've created. So 
  we don't pay a performance cost at runtime for using this version to express the data 
  transformation.
</p>
<p>
  Looking back at our initial <code>subject-groups</code> implementation, I admit I'm 
  not convinced that either one is definitively better than the other. 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054783.js?file=cjones-20110327-14.clj"></script>
<p>
  However, I do find the data transformation pattern encouraged by the threading macros 
  to be a compelling way to visualize this process, and in many cases you don't even 
  need the argument-swapping hack to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
  <em>pause</em>
</p>
<p>
  OK, you're right, you're not a mad scientist and therefore the example doesn't apply 
  to you directly, but the bind it puts you into from a threading macro perspective is 
  very real-world. The fact is that when data is being threaded through your forms, the 
  macro depends on the position of the data being consistent throughout the flow. This 
  problem will also come up (for instance) anytime you're using <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> 
  to thread sequential data, and you need to <code>conj</code> something onto it, since 
  <code>conj</code> takes a sequence as the <em>first</em> argument.
</p>
<p>
  I'm interested to hear how you feel about these two versions of <code>subject-groups</code>, 
  and what you might do differently.

  Also if this stuff whets your programming appetite for Clojure, you might consider 
  attending <a href="http://8thlight.com/courses/2-clojure-functional-programming-on-the-jvm">

  guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
  [1] We're choosing to represent the data structure this way because (let's say) our 
  lookups will be by user much more frequently than by group. We'll worry about analyzing 
  the results of the experiment later.
