<p>
	<i>This blog post doubles as my proposal for a talk I'd like to give at 
	<a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship 2011</a></i>
</p>
<h3>Front End Craftsmanship: Toward a more meaningful web</h3>
<p>
	With the advent of 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#cssom">CSS3</a>, 
	<a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA 
	we now have the ability to design our web applications with a semantic richness that can 
	help bridge the gap between human and computer [readability] and make the web a more accessible 
	place.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, despite the advancements of the web standards movement, many of us largely ignore, 
	misunderstand or misapply these front end technologies.
</p>
<p>
	Can we take pride in being called "craftsmen" if we continue to hastily construct the most public 
	facing ends of our software (with code viewable by anyone!?) ? As craftsmen, we owe our namesakes 
	to our willingness to go beyond the status quo. Our applications should be designed and built in 
	such a way that they are usable, accessible, and responsiveâ€”front end and back, for as many 
	people/devices as possible.
</p>	
<p>
	As a UX Craftsman, I view S.C.N.A. as an opportunity to help my developer colleagues better 
	understand HTML5, CSS3 and basic [client-side] design principles in the spirit of working 
	together toward a more meaningful web.
</p>
<h3>Proposed Talking Points</h3>
<p>
	<i>These points are subject to change. I am open to suggestions.</i>
</p>
<h4>Raise your [design] awareness.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>What is "design"? Who's responsible? How do you know what's good?</li>
	<li>Style vs. Design and why the difference is important</li>
	<li>Design from the content out</li>
	<li>Meaningful typography on the web</li>
	<li>Decison making made easier (grids and scales)</li>
	<li>Authentic inspiration</li>
</ul>
<h4>Start making sense.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Using HTML as intended (avoiding tables and "div-itis")</li>
	<li>Getting naked: Using browser defaults to check structure</li>
	<li>HTML5 Horizons: What to use now, what to use soon</li>
	<li>Filling in the gaps with WAI-ARIA</li>
</ul>	
<h3>Use Responsively.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Modular CSS: An object oriented approach</li>
	<li>CSS Positioning</li>
	<li>Filling in the gaps with Microformats</li>
	<li>Responsive layouts with CSS3 Media Queries</li>
	<li>Avoiding and/or optimizing images</li>
	<li>Formatting stylesheets humanely for maintainability</li>
</ul>
