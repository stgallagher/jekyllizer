title: A Tale of Two Forms (Part 2)

<p>
  Last week, I wrote a 
  <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2011/4/14/marking-up-a-semantic-form">brief article</a> 
  that demonstrated how to build a form with well structured, semantic markup. In that article, I started 
  with a form built using HTML table elements and converted it to a form built with lighter weight divs 
  and form specific elements. To recap, we were left with a form that looked like this:

       height="400" 
       alt="semantic-form" 
       width="600" 
       style="border:1px solid #dddddd; margin:20px 0;">
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  The main point of last week's article was to demonstrate that semantic HTML and CSS could be used to create 
  a form identical in appearance to one built using tables, which lend an inherent structure at the expense of 
  accessibility and maintainability. Of particular note last week was that both forms used the same amount of 
  CSS, which I know came as a surprise to a number of my developer colleagues. You can

</p>  
<p>
  And while this conversion represented a step in the right direction, we can take the transformation of our 
  original "tabular" form further by making it even more accessible and usable. To do this, we'll add a few 
  more descriptive HTML elements and attributes.
</p>
<h3>Attributes to make your forms <i>more</i> accessible</h3>
<p>
  The "semantic" form we created last week really did the bare minimum as far as accessibility was concerned. 
  By including few special HTML form attributes in our markup, we can grab some low hanging fruit and instantly 
  improve the accessibility of our form. It's a great first step. Here's how:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    For those users who have difficulty using a mouse, we can make it possible to navigate, interact with, and 
    complete our form using only the keyboard. The two attributes that will aid with this are 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2">accesskey</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex">tabindex</a>.
  </li>  
<!--
<input accesskey="f" name="first-name" tabindex="1" type="text">
view rawkeyboard-attributes.htmlThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
-->
<p>
  <i>Accesskey</i> will allow users to activate the :focus state of any input using its associated value in 
  combination with a browser specific key combination. In the above example, one could trigger the first name 
  field in Chrome by typing: ctrl + option (alt) + f. We can clue users into this possibility by wrapping the 
  appropriate character in a span tag and styling it a little differently, like so:
</p>
<p>

       width="377"></a>
</p>
<p>
  By ordering our inputs correctly using the tabindex attribute, we can insure that users will engage with 
  our form's inputs (or the elements on the rest of our webpage for that matter) in the correct order as they 
  press the tab key. This becomes increasingly important as forms become complex.
</p>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI ARIA</a> role attributes offer a semantic way for us to layer even 
    more meaning into our form attributes. According to the W3: <i>"These semantics are designed to allow an author 
    to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level 
    markup."</i> Using predefined roles, we can be ultra-specific about the intent of our HTML elements. In turn, 
    this will help screen readers and other assistive devices enable impaired users to complete our forms. Implementing 
    these roles is simple:
  </li> 
<!-- 
<form role="form">
<input role="input" type="text">
view rawroles.htmlThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
-->
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Attributes to make your forms <i>more</i> usable</h3>
    <p>
      It should come as no surprise to you that most people don't like filling out forms, which makes it hugely 
      important that you reduce the amount of friction involved in filling them out. Luckily, there are a few 
      HTML attributes (some specific to HTML 5) we can use, with little cost, to enhance the usability of our 
      forms:

      </a>
  </li>  
  <li>
    The HTML 5 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute">
      placeholder</a> attribute allows us to leave visible hints about how to complete a particular input. This comes in 
      especially handy in situations where there might be a number of different ways to complete a field, like when asking 
      for a user's phone number. Using the placeholder attribute, we can alleviate confusion, uncertainty and frustration 
      by providing an upfront example for how we expect users to enter their phone numbers:
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rocketspops/5641081138/" 
       title="Screen shot 2011-04-21 at 11.34.02 AM by rocketspops, on Flickr">
    <img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5145/5641081138_b001a7d899_o.png" 
         height="60" 
         alt="Screen shot 2011-04-21 at 11.34.02 AM" 
         width="372">
    </a>
<!--
<input name="phone" placeholder="8004156309" type="text">
view rawplaceholder.htmlThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
-->
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition to the <i>placeholder</i> attribute, we can aid users in filling out fields correctly by placing contraints 
    on the values they input. Continuing with the phone number example from above, if your system expects inputs of a certain 
    length, why allow the user to input more characters than what's allowed? Using the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-maxlength-attribute">maxlength</a>
    attribute, we can limit the number of characters a user can enter into a field specifying a value that corresponds to our 
    system's contraints, like so:
<!--    
<input maxlength="10" name="phone" type="text">
view rawmaxlength.htmlThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
-->
  </li>
  <li>
    With the HTML 5 <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2011/4/21/a-tale-of-two-forms-part-2#">autofocus</a> 
    attribute, we can save our users some time (and a click) by offering the convenience of "pre-focusing" the first input 
    of our form. While certainly not a show stopper, it's a nice touch that can benefit those users who either have trouble 
    with a mouse or prefer not to use one:
<!--
<input autofocus name="first-name" type="text">
view rawautofocus.htmlThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
