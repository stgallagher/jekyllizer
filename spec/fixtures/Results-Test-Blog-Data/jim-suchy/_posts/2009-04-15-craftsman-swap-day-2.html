<h2>
  Every week, Obtiva sets aside time for what they call Hackfest (I believe this grew out
  of Geekfest, which is what I’d describe as a Lunch ‘n Learn). Everyone is encouraged to
  take some time over lunch to work on some non-client code, and the emphasis is on
  &ldquo;doing&rdquo; instead of just talking.
</h2>
<p>
  I really like the idea of HackFest. By encouraging employees to spend time on side
  projects, the company (and employee) can only benefit. Client-work is necessary in
  order for us to get paid, but the passion for the craft cannot flourish if the only
  projects one is working on is for someone else. There is something selfish about
  software development, and that isn’t a bad thing.
</p> 
<p>
  In order for you to enjoy your job, I believe that you have to get satisfaction out
  of what you’re doing every day. I think that’s why I’m such a fan of Test Driven Development.
  There is always a goal, usually only a maximum of a couple minutes out: either get the
  current test to pass, or write a failing test (don’t forget to refactor).
</p> 
<p>
  This constant flow is encouraging because every time you get your tests to green, there
  is a feeling of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
  So for Hackfest, I joined <a href="http://andymaleh.blogspot.com/">Andy Maleh</a> on his
  project, which is in the really early concept phase. We worked through some mockups and
  designs for a social website that he has in the works.
</p> 
<p>
  Basically, we designed and drew up paper mockups of a critical feature. 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping">Paper prototyping</a> is 
  intended to help developers create a user experience that meets the user’s needs.
</p> 
<p>
  One possible mistake that you can make, as I certainly have, is to forget that you have AJAX
  effects at your disposal in your web application, and that your prototypes should be built
  with that in mind.
</p> 
<p>
  Instead of every user input resulting in a new (paper) page being put down in front of the
  user, consider simulating the slide effect that would occur when you click an &ldquo;add&rdquo;
  button which dynamically inserts a new form into the page.
</p>
<p>
  By just replacing the entire page in front of the user, you’re really missing the user
  experience improvements that <abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">AJAX</abbr>
  can give you. Andy’s mockups did this well, and I think that they will result in more
  successful user testing.
</p>
<h3>Afternoon Pairing</h3>
<p>
  I paired with Nate Jackson for the good part of the rest of the afternoon. Nate was Obtiva’s
  third apprentice and is now a consultant. We were working on a really cool iPhone application,
  but mainly I just slowed Nate down.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that bothers me about developing for the iPhone is how difficult it is to test the
  code that touches the framework; in particular, all of the delegates in the controllers. I would
  like to gain a better understanding of how the framework really works so that maybe I can find
  some better seams for testing purposes.
</p> 
<p>
  As a result of this inherent difficulty, we didn’t test drive the code that was written, and I
  noticed that the rhythm of the pairing session was distinctly different from the ping-pong sessions
  that I’ve grown accustomed to.
</p>
<p>
  Without the failing test/passing test rhythm, there aren’t distinct break points where the keyboard
  naturally gets passed. So though the pairing session was successful, it definitely felt different.
