<h2>
  I spent my day pairing with <a href="http://nuts.redsquirrel.com/">Dave Hoover</a>
  on <a href="http://madmimi.com/">Mad Mimi</a>. The first thing I noticed during our
  pairing session is that Dave has many more responsibilities within Obtiva than just coding.
  The opportunities for distractions seem to increase exponentially the closer you are to the
  details of running a business.
</h2> 
<p>
  The context switching involved in handling interruptions while coding is something that I 
  really struggle with, but Dave is quite adept at it. Having a pair helps with ignoring these
  distractions, for better or for worse.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve been using the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a> 
  for the past couple months with some success to try to help stay focused and deal with
  distractions, but I’ve found that the best way to avoid distractions is to pair program.
</p> 
<p>
  Dave “thanked” me at the end of the day for helping him ignore his growing list of unread
  emails, which he would have to catch up on later. The upshot of this is that we got some
  concentrated work done without a ton of distractions taking our attention away from the task.
</p>
<p>
  At the start of the day, we picked up a new Mad Mimi feature and started discussing it. As
  is usually the case when beginning to dig into a feature, we quickly came up with some questions
  for which we would need the customer’s input.
</p> 
<p>
  Unfortunately, the customer wasn’t available; after making note of the questions, we started
  talking about a change that will be rolled out sometime in the near future, but should not be
  added just yet. Dave accurately identified the need to create a branch for the feature.
</p> 
<p>
  I’ve recently had a similar need for this kind of feature branch, and I’ve done this a couple
  times in the past few months. Dave hadn’t created a branch in Subversion before, so here was a
  chance to teach him something.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few different reasons why you might want to use this technique, but this is the
  situation I’ve been running into lately. There are (at least) two different types of 
  branches: bug fix / release, and feature.
</p> 
<p>
  When releasing a new version of the system, a release branch can be created in order to allow
  bug fixes to be quickly and safely developed and deployed. A feature branch, on the other hand,
  comes in handy in a number of situations.
</p> 
<p>
  One situation is when you want to develop a new feature that needs to be deployed as an update
  to the release. If you were to develop the feature on the release branch, you would run the risk
  of making deploying the branch at a moment’s notice difficult or impossible. By developing on a
  feature branch, you can develop and test the feature in isolation, then merge the changes back
  to the release branch (and/or the trunk).
</p> 
<p>
  In Dave’s case, he releases from the trunk, but he wanted this particular feature to not be deployed
  until he’s ready. A feature branch works great in this case, and he’ll only have to merge back to the
  trunk since there isn’t a need for a release branch.
</p> 
<p>
  Once that merge is done, the branch can (and should) be killed; the key to keeping your branches 
  manageable is to limit the number of branches that you ever need to think about. The goal should
  be for each branch to have the shortest lifetime as possible. For a decent branching strategy,
  see <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/quicksvnbranch.html">this article</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After Dave successfully created his branch (and played around with merging to understand how that 
  would work), we went ahead and started implementing this new feature on the branch. Of course,
  we soon were able to get the information we needed from the customer to continue on the original
  (higher priority) feature.
</p> 
<p>
  Since we were working on the branch, we didn’t need to abandon our work in order to start on the
  other feature. We just opened up the trunk’s code in our editor and away we went. This is another
  advantage of working in a feature branch: it’s simple and cheap to jump around.
</p> 
<p>
  We spent the rest of the day working on this feature, though we ended the day without completing it.
  We will finish it up on day 4.
