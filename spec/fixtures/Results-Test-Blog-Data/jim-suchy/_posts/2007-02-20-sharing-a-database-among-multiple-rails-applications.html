title: Sharing a Database Among Multiple Rails Applications
tag:
---

<h2>
  A sign of the success of Ruby on Rails is the size of applications being written with it.
  Currently, we are working on a project with many interconnecting modules that we split up
  into separate Rails applications.
</h2>
<p> 
  However, the business domain was the same among the projects, resulting in the different
  projects sharing the same database. This article discusses the way we’ve accomplished this.
</p> 
<h3>Create a Lib Project</h3> 
<p>
  We first need a place to pull our common classes into. This will not be a Rails application;
  it will just be a Ruby module that your Rails application will require. Our directory structure
  will look something like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051156.js?file=jsuchy-20070220-1.sh"></script>
<p>
  Now we can move on to the actual refactoring.
</p> 
<h3>Pull the Models Out</h3> 
<p>
  The first step is the easiest: pull out the models from the app/models directory of your Rails
  application into the lib directory of your new library.
</p>
<p>
  In the config/environments.rb file within your Rails application, you will need to add this
  new directory to your Ruby search path by adding this line to the end of the file.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051156.js?file=jsuchy-20070220-2.rb"></script>
<p>More on the Ruby search path later.</p>
<h3>Pull the Tests Out</h3> 
<p>
  Let’s move on to making our specs pass. Now that we don't have the Ruby environments loaded
  up as part of our test helpers (spec_helper for the rspecers out there), we need to establish
  an Active Record connection ourselves. 
</p>
<p>
  Create a spec helper for our lib specs and start it with the connection to the database like so:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051156.js?file=jsuchy-20070220-3.rb%20"></script>
<p>
  This is the same way Rails sets up your database connections for active record when you load
  the Rails environment. Now your specs just need to require this new spec_helper in order to
  get Active Record functioning.
</p> 
<h3>Use Models Across Projects</h3> 
<p>
  Now you are free to use the same database across many projects. To do this, you just need
  to either require a single lib file that loads all the models, or you could put the lib 
  directory in your Ruby search path.
</p> 
<h3>Ruby Search Path vs. Lib Require File</h3> 
<p>
  The new common library will need to be included in your rails application. There are two
  methods we have used to do this. The first is to create a library file that does nothing more
  than requires all of the common lib files, looking something like the following:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051156.js?file=jsuchy-20070220-4.rb%20"></script>
<p>
  The problem with this approach is it requires you to sequence the require statements in the
  appropriate order, or else you will get errors about missing objects. The benefit is that you
  load the entire environment in one place rather than adding require statements at the top of
  each file to include the needed external dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  These code files that do nothing but require files are no stranger to Ruby; however, they must
  be managed properly as they become temperamental and irritable when dependencies are mixed up.
</p>
<p>
  The other approach we have used is what I recommended above. In your Rails application’s environment,
  add the lib directory to your search path, and include the require statements as needed in each model file.
  Of course, by including one file you will be implicitly including all of the dependencies. Using this
  technique, you can eliminate files that just require other files.
