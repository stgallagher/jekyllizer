title: Up and running with TDD on Android
tag:
---

<h2>
  A couple of weeks ago, I happened to be in the right place at the right time (the
  first ORD Session) when Google hooked a bunch of developers up with an Android Dev
  Phone 1.
</h2> 
<p>
  I'd been interested in Android for awhile because it's a more open platform than the
  iPhone, and the code is Java (I've never worked in Objective-C), so I was excited.
</p> 
<p>
  After my initial excitement of hacking around and getting things to work, I decided to
  regain my discipline and figure out a workflow for 
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>. The good news is that JUnit is built
  right into the Java framework that Android app have available.
</p>
<p>
  The less-good news is that writing and running tests on Android isn't as well-documented
  as many other facets of the application framework. I'd like to share my setup, which
  doesn't depend on any specific <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
  or text editor.
</p> 
<p>
  I'm assuming Mac or Linux here, but I'm sure Windows would only require minimal 
  changes. Other assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/index.html">The Android SDK</a>
    is installed
  </li>
  <li>Android tools directory is on the <code>PATH</code></li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> is on the machine and on the 
    <code>PATH</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<small>
  Note: The &ldquo;tools&rdquo; directory is the main one, not the one below 
  &ldquo;platforms.&rdquo; In my case: <code>/Users/colin/lib/android/tools</code>.
</small>
<p>
  Let's get started by creating a project with the command-line utility, which will
  give you the test directory structure and build files that you need (you won't get
  these with the Eclipse or IntelliJ plugins, for instance).
</p>
<p>
  Of course, you can read documentation for the android command to see more details,
  but here's what we're doing:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-1.sh"></script>
<p>
  All of these options are required (<code>-n</code>, the project name, is optional,
  and I've left it out above)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>-t</code> is the build target platform (1 refers to Android version1.1
    on my machine, see the ids in <code>$ android list targets</code> for yours. 
    This is important to remember as you'll need to refer to it later)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>-p</code> is the path of the new project to create (make up a folder
    name for your new project
  </li>
  <li><code>-a</code> is the first Activity that you want to create</li>
  <li><code>-k</code> is your package name</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Next, we want to create an <abbr title="Android Virtual Device">AVD</abbr> 
  (Android Virtual Device) if one doesn't already exist&mdash;it's an emulator 
  for the phone operating system. We can check to see if one exists already first:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-2.sh"></script>
<p>
  If you don't have an <abbr title="Android Virtual Device">AVD</abbr> already,
  create one:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-3.sh"></script>
<p>
  You'll be asked if you want a custom hardware profile (I don't, so I just hit Return).
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-n</code> is the name of the new device</li>
  <li>
    <code>-t</code> is the target platform, as before (and it should match your
    project's platform)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  At this point, let's go ahead and fire up the emulator, making sure to match the name
  to the one you created. It's good to make sure that our state at this early point is
  a good one.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-4.sh"></script>
<p>
  Here I'm launching the emulator <abbr title="Android Virtual Device">(AVD)</abbr> in 
  the background so I don't need to open up a new Terminal window. You'll get some output
  in your terminal window; if it bothers you, Ctrl-L will freshen it up. 
</p>
<p>
  Now we'll build and install both of your apps (the test package is really a separate
  application, which is a good idea to keep the tests out of the eventual deployment
  package anyway):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-5.sh"></script>
<p>
  The debug target isn't actually defined in either buildfile (build.xml or tests/build.xml),
  but is available nonetheless (see <code>$ ant help</code> for other targets you might not
  otherwise find). This takes care of bundling resources, compiling, converting classfiles
  to Android's .dex format, and packaging.
</p>
<p>
  Note that adb is NOT ant&mdash;it's the Android Debug Bridge, and it's invaluable for working
  with the emulator. The <code>-r</code> option to <code>adb install</code> reinstalls the
  package if necessary. Now, this is pretty redundant-looking, but just remember that the
  tests directory is a sort of parallel structure with your project directory, and you need both.
</p>
<p>
  It's time to run the default test suite that the <code>android create project</code> call has
  given us (this can be run either from tests directory or from the root of the project):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-6.sh"></script>
<p>
  Of course, you'll want to substitute your package and activity names for the ones in my
  examples. It's very important to realize that you've just compiled and installed your 
  software on the emulator and are running tests on it there.
</p>
<p>
  In order to do <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>, you'll need to recompile
  changed code and reinstall on the emulator. I hope that one day there will be a way to avoid
  going through the emulator each time (or that there already is one that I've been unable
  to find), but this is the only method I've been able to get working so far. 
</p>
<p>
  Now we need to actually add a real test to (in my case) 
  <code>tests/src/com/colinwjones/TicTacToeTest.java</code>. Here, an 
  <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> like IntelliJ or Eclipse comes
  in handy, especially if you're just starting with Android and aren't sure of the methods
  you might want to use.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-7.java"></script>
<p>
  Building our test package at this point will fail, since no resource with the 
  <code>new_button</code> id exists yet. Let's do it anyway to see the first failure and
  guide us to our implementation code (running this from the tests directory):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-8.sh"></script>
<p>
  The error tells us where to go next: we'll implement the button in 
  <code>/layout/main.xml</code> (making sure to set the right ID on the button).
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051899.js?file=cjones-20090711-9.xml"></script>
<p>
  Since we changed the main layout, the implementation package needs to be built first,
  then the test package:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-11.sh"></script>
<p>
  Now run the tests again:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-12.sh"></script>
<p>
  Great! Now we have a proper failure:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-13.sh"></script>
<p>
  We just need to add the right text in the 
  <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> layout:
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-14.xml"></script>
<p>
  Let's rid of the default &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; TextView in main.xml
  while we're at it. Now rebuild, reinstall, and re-run tests:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-15.sh"></script>
<p>
  This is getting annoying typing all these commands: we're going to want to 
  write a shell script or Ant task to do this for us. But for the time being,
  we'll plod through (that was the last time, though). Now we're passing:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-16.sh"></script>
<p>
  It's a bit strange that the test runner claims we have 2 tests: each test
  class will add one of its own.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we've seen how to get the tests running, let's automate it by
  adding Ant tasks to the build.xml in the main project directory. 
</p>
<p>
  You'll need to set the environment variable <code>ANDROID_TOOLS</code>
  for this exact task to work, or you can provide the full path to <code>adb</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-17.xml"></script>
<p>
  Now we can just run:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051833.js?file=cjones-20090711-18.sh"></script>
<p>
  from the project directory (assuming the emulator is already up and running
  with <code> emulator -avd ColinPhone &</code>), and we'll be good to go.
</p>
<p>
  Honestly, it's a pretty simple process: the key for me was in using the Android
  command-line tools rather than <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
  plugins. It helped me to understand the build process and get beyond the initial frustration
  of not having the <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> do the
  work for me.
</p>
<p>
  I imagine things will change a bit for Windows users, so please leave comments if
  there's anything drastically different (and also if things change for Mac/Linux
  users as the framework develops).
</p>
<p>
  I do hope this will help someone else to get set up and save the headache I had
  when first discovering Android.
