<h2>
  In a web saturated with numerous opinion blogs, gallery showcases, tutorial sites
  and technical references, where should an aspiring web developer go to seek knowledge 
  about basic web design?
</h2>
<p>
  If you are just starting to expand your design awareness&mdash;and you don't have 
  the luxury of being plugged into a network of savvy designers&mdash;it can really be
  difficult to determine where to look, what to read, and who to listen to.
</p>
<p>
  In my first two weeks working at 8th Light, several of my developer colleagues have
  expressed interest in learning more about the wizardry that goes into the front-end:
  whether they've been perplexed by an unfamiliar piece of software, or impressed by
  the structure of a well-formatted style sheet.
</p>
<p>
  So, I thought it would be a good idea to share some of the resources I've collected
  over the yearsâ€”resources that I keep coming back to, again and again, for aesthetic,
  technical, or ethical guidance. The following list isn't exhaustive, but it will 
  provide a jumping off point for those developers looking to heighten their design <abbr>IQ</abbr>:

      <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books.html#33">The Design of Everyday Things</a> 
      <i>by</i> Donald Norman</h4>
    <p>
      This book provides profound insights into the nature of human computer
      interaction. By examining overlooked design principles,
       Norman ensures that you&rsquo;ll never think about your surroundings in the 
       same way again.

    <p>
      A concise and well written introduction to the many components of web design including:
      research, color, typography, layout, grids, and more. This book will grant you an

    <p>
      Typography is the most essential component of any graphic design (either for web or print).
      Difficult to master, its often misunderstood by new designers. Read this book and open 
      yourself up to new ways of seeing.

    <h4>Opera Web Standards Curriculum</h4>
    <p>
      I believe that to do good work designers must be able to read, write and

         height="90">
    <h4>FFFFound!</h4>
    <p>
      It's a good practice to seek inspiration from other creative realms like advertising, 
      photography and visual art. <a href="http://ffffound.com/">FFFFound!</a> is photographic stream 
      of the stuff. It's a beautiful cornucopia. Go get lost in it!

    <h4>Site Inspire</h4>
    <p>
      The web is saturated with so called "galleries" that purport to exhibit the best work on the
      web, but that merely follow the latest trends. <a href="http://siteinspire.net/">Site Inspire</a>,
      on the other hand, exhibits websites that buck familiar design trends.

<h3>Applications for Productivity</h3>

         height="90">
    <h4>Ommwriter</h4>
    <p>
      Writing is a crucial part of interface design, but it's a laborious process. And while no tool can
      make you a better writer, <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter</a> makes it easier to focus
      on the task by removing the distractions of traditional word processors.

         width="90" 
         height="90">
    <h4>xScope</h4>
    <p>
      When I encounter the need to measure an element on-screen, establish an alignment grid, or grab the 
      hexcode for an appealing color, I count on <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope/">xScope</a>
      to do the job quickly and easily. It's a major time saver.

         width="90" 
         height="90">
    <h4>Things</h4>
    <p>
      I have a tendency to forget things. Rather than trying to keep track of everything I need to get done
      in my head, I rely on <a href="http://siteinspire.net/">Things</a>. It frees up brain power so I can 
      focus on the stuff that matters: like the tasks at hand.
