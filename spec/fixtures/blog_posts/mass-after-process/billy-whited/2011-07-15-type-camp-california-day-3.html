<h2>
  On Day two of Type Camp California we were given a short &ldquo;homework&rdquo; 
  assignment: write a six word autobiography containing your name, at
  least one verb and at least one adjective or adverb. 
</h2>
<p>
  Although I did give some thought to this assignment, I had no idea 
  that it would be the foundation for the next day&rsquo;s exercises. Had
  I known this, I might have chosen to be a little less clever with 
  what I wrote. By the end of the day, I had grown quite tired of what
  I&rsquo;d written, which went a little something like this: 
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    William,<br />
    With <br />
    Whimsy, <br />
    Weightlessly <br />
    Weathers <br />
    Wayward <br />
  </i>
</p>
<h3>Day 3 Exercises</h3>
<h4>Bespoke Lettering</h4>
<p>
  The first exercise of Day 3 was, by my estimation, the most challenging 
  of all the exercises we undertook while at Type Camp.
</p> 
<p>
  We were tasked with drawing a couple of words from our autobiographies in a 
  style all our own. The goal of this exercise was to create a unique typographic
  composition that captured the essence of our chosen words (in my case &ldquo;weightless&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;weathering&rdquo;). It was a task for which I was ill-prepared.
</p> 
<p>
  Interestingly, I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any pictures of my completed 
  lettering. I guess this isn&rsquo;t all that surprising considering that I didn&rsquo;t
  execute the assignment very well. Still, I did manage to find a couple of 
  concept sketches from my attempt at lettering the word &ldquo;Weightless&rdquo;.

<p>
  Though the design was rigidly conceived, being <i>truly</i> geometric, I was proud
  of the floating letter <b>e</b> I conceived. I felt it really put the &ldquo;less&rdquo; in 
  &ldquo;weightless.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  One instructor mentioned that good technique for starting a lettering project
  is to think about a word, feeling or concept that contrasts sharply with the 
  phrase you&rsquo;re trying to illustrate. I often find that pulling your imagination
  to extremes creates tension and opens your mind up to a world of possibilities
  that might not have been immediately obvious.
</p> 
<p>
  I thought this piece of advice was really sound. It has implications for life 
  as well as for art.

<h4>The Shakespeare Press Day 2</h4> 
<p>
  During the latter half of Day 3 we visited The Shakespeare Press Museum for a 
  another day of letterpress adventure. Many of us had unfinished projects from 
  the previous day and the additional hours in the workshop gave my partner 
  Fraser Bingham and I, the extra time we need to put the finishing touches 
  on our Bollock$ Bookmarks:

  However, the main objective of this afternoon session was to print our six
  word autobiographies. Once I discovered we were to do this, I regretted
  choosing to start each of my six words with a prominent letter <b>w</b> 
  for I was sure this was going to create a challenge for me. 
</p>
<p>
  Yet, despite my initial hesitation, I really enjoyed this type-setting 
  challenge. I think it inspired in me a daring and creative solution. 
</p>
<p>
  While many other Type Campers went large with their compositions (with 
  good reason considering that the Shakespeare press had a rather lovely 
  collection of wood type!), I decided to go small.
</p>
<p> 
  Really small.
</p>
<p> 
  Really, <i>really</i> small.
</p> 
<p>
  In fact, I chose to set my autobiography in the smallest typeface available
  at the Shakespeare Press Museum: 4pt Bank Gothic fixed to a 6pt body. 
  Hand setting letters of this size is extremely tedious and requires
  great patience and care.  It&rsquo;s quite easy to lose or damage lead type that
  is mere 1/12th of an inch in size.

  I knew I wanted to set my autobiography on 6 lines, and because I was using 
  4pt type on a 6pt body, I knew I could set my composition &ldquo;solid.&rdquo; This meant 
  that a piece of type at 36pt would neatly span the six lines of my passage&mdash;perfect for 
  my uppercase <b>W</b> (which adorned the beginning of each line).

<p>
  Using a just a single <b>e</b> offset some of the concerns I had in a setting a 
  composition with 6 uppercase <b>w&rsquo;s</b> and contributed to a final result that was
  quite legible, fun and dare I say, creative?
