title: A Functional Refactoring in Scala

<h2>
  Many of us have heard a lot of talk about functional programming and its benefits,
  especially when it comes to highly concurrent applications where thread locking and
  synchronization would be necessary in order to avoid mangling state among processes.
</h2>
<p>
  Languages like Scala, Erlang, and Clojure are increasingly coming to mind as people
  look for ways to take advantage of multiple-core processors without the headaches
  threading can create. While I'm not quite ready to take the plunge and completely
  eliminate state from my programming, I'm looking for more and more ways to get rid
  of it when possible.
</p> 
<p>
  In doing so, I've come across several situations where a simple refactoring to a more
  functional style can yield rewards in readability and testability, and I'd like to
  talk about one of them here.
</p>
<p>
  Simple <code>while</code> loops are one of the imperative programmer's most basic tools, 
  and it might seem difficult to eliminate mutable state. However, a little persistence can
  pay off. Let's start with the following Scala code:
</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
def printUpTo(limit: Int): Unit = 
{
  var i = 0
  while(i <= limit)
  {
    println("i = " + i)
    i += 1
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  It's clear that state is changing inside this function, highlighted by the use of Scala's
  <code>var</code> keyword that specifies a variable that is allowed to change 
  (<code>val</code> variables are unmodifiable). 
</p>
<p>
  While this state change isn't visible from the outside (a new copy of the variable is
  created each time the function is entered), <code>var</code> often means there's
  unnecessary clutter in the code and that it can be simplified. And indeed it can.
</p>
<p> 
  First of all, any programmer worth her salt would first change this to a
  <code>for</code> loop. A Java implementation might look like this:
</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
void printUpTo(int limit)
{
  for(int i = 0; i <= limit, i++)
  {
    System.out.println("i = " + i)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Scala's for loops look more like Java's foreach syntax:
</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
def printUpTo(limit: Int): Unit = {
  for(i <- (0 to limit)) {
    println("i = " + i)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  In addition to the Java-like iterating structure (left-arrow instead of :); the range
  specification <code>(0 to limit)</code> is a Scala built-in, but there are also libraries for ranges
  in Java, Ruby, and plenty of other languages. 
</p>
<p>
  The code in the last example seems to more clearly encapsulate the structure of the function.
  The first and last lines in the <code>while</code> based version of <code>printUpTo</code>
  are just boilerplate code, and while most any programmer can easily follow the structure of
  the code, we should always be striving for improvement.
</p>
<p>
  In general, I find that I'm less likely to have bugs with a smaller codebase. Certainly
  there are exceptions (regular expressions comes to mind), but assuming that two pieces
  of code both read well, I'd rather have less to read.
</p>
<p>
  In the preceding Scala for loop syntax, <code>i</code> is implicitly a <code>val</code> 
  within the context of the loop, which means it can't be reassigned to a new value. This
  is a great step forward, as we could initially have created an infinite loop by manipulating
  the value of <code>i</code> inside the while loop. We have now insulated ourselves against
  this type of change.
</p>
<p>
  Another functional way to write essentially the same loop would be to use Scala's 
  <code>foreach</code>, a method available on Lists and Ranges that takes a function as a parameter.
</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
def printUpTo(limit: Int): Unit = {
  (0 to limit).foreach {
    i => println("i = " + i)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  This seems more expressive to me, as it emphasizes the importance of the range object in the loop.
  It would also have given us the ability to use a shorthand if we'd not needed the 
  <code>"i =" text</code>:
{% highlight scala linenos %}
(0 to limit).foreach(println _)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>or even&hellip;</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
(0 to limit).foreach(println)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>But there is also something to be said for the familiarity of the more traditional 
  <code>for</code> construct.
</p>
<p>
  The code above is still not completely functional, however, because the <code>println</code>
  statement depends upon the definition of standard output at the time (imagine redefining
  it to a <code>java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream</code>, for example). This also makes the function
  hard to test.  
</p>
<p>
  Now, if we're going to build an application to work at the console, at some point
  we're going to have to actually use <code>println</code> if we want the user to know that the
  application is working. Does this mean that the functional approach completely eschews input and
  output streams?  Certainly not, but we have two problems in the example at hand:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>printUpTo</code> is responsible for both the construction of each member of a group of
      output strings, and for the actual printing of those strings. Therefore, the function has two
      reasons to change. For instance, we might want to change the information that gets printed on
      each line or its formatting. We might also want to change how the output gets to the user. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>printUpTo</code> is awkward to test.  In order to verify that the correct output comes
    goes to the user, we'll need to either find a mocking library to change the way the Console
    object behaves, or redirect standard output to another stream that we can read to verify its
    contents afterwards (maybe a <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I'd prefer a further refactoring in order to alleviate these issues. The problem of verifying
  console output in our test code won't be completely eliminated, but we'll at least isolate it
  to its own test. Here, we're extracting <code>println</code> from the string-building part of
  the code:
</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
def printUpTo(limit: Int): Unit = {
  applyUpTo(limit, println)
}

def applyUpTo(limit: Int, action: String => Unit): Unit = {
  (0 to limit).foreach {
    i => action("i = " + i)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Now we can test <code>applyUpTo</code> by passing our own custom action in, and tests for
  <code>println</code>-based behavior can be isolated, so that we isolate some of the necessary
  mocking and redirection.  
</p>
<p>
  As a word of explanation, the <code>action</code> passed in needs to take a <code>String</code>
  as an argument and return the <code>Unit</code> value: <code>()</code>. Now we can also move
  <code>printUpTo</code> to a different class if we so desire (assuming this function is part of
  a larger application), eliminating our need to recompile the code in <code>printUpTo</code> each
  time the string format changes.
</p>
<p>
  I'd most likely put the <code>applyUpTo</code> call on its own in a <code>main()</code> method
  if there's really nothing more to the application.
</p>
<p>
  There is another problem with the code above, however: both of the functions are returning <code>Unit</code>
  values (the equivalent of Java's <code>void</code>).  This means that both of these functions rely
  on side effects to get their jobs done. 
</p>
<p>
  If we <em>were</em> to pass a side effect-free function into <code>applyUpTo</code>, we wouldn't
  actually have any output from the <code>applyUpTo</code> to tell us that we did something. A side
  effect is any effect of a function beyond its return value, so we can say that if a Scala function
  has a return type of <code>Unit</code>, there are either side effects, or it is a trivial function
  that we can safely eliminate. 
</p>
<p>We can make the helper function side effect-free like so:</p>
{% highlight scala linenos %}
def printUpTo(limit: Int): Unit = {
  buildUpTo(limit).foreach(println)
}

def buildUpTo(limit: Int): Iterable[String] = {
  (0 to limit).map("i = " + _)
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  In this case, we're relying on a bit of syntactic sugar for transferring the iterating value of
  <code>foreach</code> to <code>println</code>, and a placeholder (<code>_</code>) for 
  <code>map</code>'s iterating value.  
</p>
<p>
  The <code>buildUpTo</code> function is now more functional and more easily testable (we can
  do a fairly simple comparison with the returned Iterable), but it's important to note that
  memory usage might be a concern, as a map of all the values could become pretty large.
</p>
<p>
  Another issue with this is speed: in the more functional version, we're iterating through
  the collection twice rather than just once. We don't often get things for free, and indeed
  there is a trade-off here between memory/speed and functionality.
</p>
<p>
  The example here has been on a very small scale, and perhaps a bit contrived, but we can
  extrapolate the ideas to a wide range of refactorings. We want to remove as much code with
  side effects and mutable state as we can from the rest of our application.
</p>
<p>
  This way we can divide up the functional parts of our application among processors in order
  to take advantage of the multiple cores that we all have in our machines these days. There are
  numerous other situations in which functional programming can lead to cleaner code, and there
  are also places where it might be inappropriate or impossible.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to remember the most common reason we might want to write functional code:
  concurrency. If I'm only going to be running this small application on my local machine,
  from the command line, and printing is going to be the limiting factor speed-wise (and it
  probably will in this case), I would most likely stop at the simplest <code>foreach</code>
  version above and be done with it.
</p>
<p>
  It will be efficient with memory and fast. But when the function <code>buildUpTo</code>
  becomes more complex, or we need to run numerous instances of the application, that's where
  concurrency, and functional programming, are best applied. Our goal should be to find, and
  use, the right tool for the job.
</p>
