  Do you or someone you know have 30+ apps in your Dock, with only a small percentage of them actually opened
  at any given time? Over the years I've noticed that this is a much more prevalent situation than I would
  have guessed. So at one point I wrote a Mac app called Docks to help alleviate the problem.
</p>
<p>
  Originally Docks was trial ware, which I sold under my former company Thoughtful Tree Software. For five
  days straight in the end of 2009, it was the featured third-party download on Apple.com.
</p>
<p>
  Today, I am releasing Docks to the world, free of charge. 
  You can <a href="https://github.com/downloads/sdegutis/Docks/Docks-2.0.3.zip">download it here for free</a> 
  (requires Mac OS X 10.5 at minimum).
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of Docks is to allow users to switch between "snapshots" of their Dock. When you first launch Docks,
  it takes a "snapshot" of what icons are in your Dock and in what order. At that point, you can add, remove, and
  reorder icons in your Dock to your heart's content. Then, inside Docks, click the Take Snapshot button to 
  create another "snapshot".
</p>
<p>
  Once you have more than one snapshot, if you select one and click the Restore Snapshot button, your Dock magically
  changes to match the snapshot! All the icons in the snapshot (and no other icons) will be in your Dock,
  and in the right order.
</p>
<p>
  This is the simplicity and beauty of Docks.
</p>
<p>
  Check out the video below to see it in action. And if you're a developer like me, you may be interested to know
  that the program's source is now freely <a href="http://github.com/sdegutis/docks">available at github</a>
  under public domain. Enjoy!
</p>
<p>
  Over the next few weeks, I'll also be discussing some cool Cocoa tricks and secrets of Mac OS X that I (ab)used
  to make Docks what it is. If you wondered "how does Docks change out the Dock?" or "how is Docks so sexy?"
  then stay tuned and find out soon!
