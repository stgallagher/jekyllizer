<h1>Lending a Hand</h1>

<h2>
  At <a href="http://agile2007.com/">Agile 2007</a>, we put on a workshop called RailsFest. The original intent was to provide a one-day
  session that conference attendees could visit to get an opportunity to work on a Ruby on Rails project.
  What that project was to be, we didnâ€™t really know. In the way that things sometimes work out, we ended up
  with the opportunity to work all week with a non-profit organization that has touched more lives than most
  of us ever will.

<p>
  The organization that we were working with is called <a href="http://manoamano.org/">Mano a Mano</a>. Their mission is to
  &ldquo;improve the health and well-being of impoverished Bolivians.&rdquo; Segundo Velasquez,
  president of Mano a Mano, was our on-site customer, and I was lucky enough to work with him
  for part of the week. 
</p>
<p>
  At first, he was a little unsure of his role in the process, but by the end of the first
  afternoon he had become comfortable in expressing what he wanted the software to be.
  It was a lot of fun watching Segundo learn about and adapt to the approach that we were
  taking in creating software for his organization.
</p>
<p>
  Mano a Mano works in a very different way than most other charity organizations. Though
  they provide aid to the economic poor in Bolivia, it is not a free handout. The intent
  of the whole process is to bootstrap poor communities.
</p>
<p>
  Segundo told me of a specific project where they were able to increase the per capita income
  by 100% (from $150 to $300) the first year. By helping to provide the basic necessities that
  we often take for granted (e.g. potable water, roads to allow for the transportation of goods
  and people, etc.), the citizens were able to stop worrying about these basic things and
  concentrate on improving the lives of themselves, their families and their community.

  Though RailsFest ended last Friday, there is still work to be done. If you are interested
  in giving back a little bit through your craft, please drop me a line at jim&#64;8thlight.com.
