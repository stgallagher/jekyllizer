<h1>One Take on Configuring Rails Routes and asset_host</h1>

  We recently had an interesting requirement surface. In anticipation of the release of a number of demo
  environments, our customer requested that system configuration be able to be done at the server level.
  The goal was to avoid being forced to use source control to manage configuration files.
</h2>
<p>
  A little background is in order. The systems that we are working on are pretty large. There are two
  distinct, decoupled systems, each consisting of between 10 and 40 subsystems. Of these subsystems, 
  a handful on each side are Rails applications. Most others are small Ruby application that talk a 
  central <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/rinda">Rinda</a> server.
</p>
<p>
  We already have a configuration strategy in place for the two systems, which involves a central 
  configuration file per system which populates a globally-accessible configuration hash. The directory
  structure looks something like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-1.sh"></script>
<p>
  The <code>systemone/etc/config.rb</code> file creates the configuration hash and populates it with
  all of the appropriate configurations (in practice, <code>config.rb</code> actually loads the 
  appropriate configuration file based on an environment variable, i.e. <b>RAILSENV</b>, but we
  will ignore that here for brevity and clarity):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-2.rb"></script>
<p>
  From the context of a Rails application, this central configuration file is loaded from
  <code>railsappone/config/environment.rb</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-3.rb"></script>
<p>
  With this configuration strategy in place already, the team was tasked with setting up multiple demo
  environments for the entire system, each deployed on a different server and accessed through a different
  external URL. We could have attempted to solve the configuration issues by just adding many separate Rails
  environments, say demo1 and demo2, but there were a couple problems with that. 
</p>
<p>
  First, the configurations for the different environments would have been nearly identical. Second,
  we wanted to avoid the complexity of relying on source control to manage the configurations for each
  deployment. In most cases, relying on the Rails convention of setting up a new environment makes a lot
  of sense. However, in our case, the only differences between the environments would be setting the 
  asset_host and routes. 
</p>
<p>
  Storing this in source control means that in order to make a change to the external URL means that
  files under source control need to be modified, checked in and then redeployed to the affected system.
  It makes much more sense to have some reasonable defaults in source control and then provide a mechanism
  to override these configurations at the server level.
</p>
<p>
  The solution to this problem ended up being quite simple. We first agreed on an acceptable location for
  the server configuration file:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-4.sh"></script>
<p>
  In order to allow for overriding the system configuration, this code was added to 
  <code>/deployment/system_one/etc/config.rb</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-5.rb"></script>
<p>
  The server configuration in <code>deployment/config/serverconfig.rb</code> will be loaded (and executed),
  if it exists. If it doesn’t exist, the default configurations will be used, which is the desirable behavior.
</p>
<p>
  The first task was to configure the <code>assethost</code>. To start with, we add the desired 
  <code>assethost</code> configuration to <code>/deployment/config/serverconfig.rb</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-6.rb"></script>
<p>
  For each Rails environment that we want the assethost to be configurable from the server configuration file,
  just add this line to the appropriate config file, e.g. 
  <code>deployment/systemone/railsappone/config/environments/demo.rb:</code>
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-7.rb"></script>
<p>
  You would want to add a separate <code>assethost</code> configuration for each Rails application, and
  each Rails application would set its own <code>assethost</code> to the appropriate configuration.
</p>
<p>
  For a simple configuration like <code>asset_host</code>, this works great. For routes, though, it
  gets a bit more complicated. We need a 
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Routing/RouteSet/Mapper.html">Mapper</a>
  instance in order to build a route. For example, your routes configuration looks something like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-8.rb"></script>
<p>
  We initially saw two options.
</p> 
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a data structure representing the desired routes, store it in the configuration, then from
    the routes file iterate through the structure created in the configuration file, creating the
    appropriate routes;
  </li>
  <li>
    Store some Ruby code in the configuration so that the context (i.e. the Mapper instance) can be
    passed to the block at the run-time.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This second option eliminates the need for a secondary data structure to represent the routes.
  How better to configure the routes than with the actual code used to configure them?
</p>
<p>
  It turned out that this was nearly as simple as the <code>assethost</code> configuration. First, let’s define
  the routes in <code>/deployment/config/serverconfig.rb</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051319.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-9.rb"></script>
<p>
  We have used the lambda method to convert a block into a Proc object. The Proc object is stored as
  a value in a hash which can be executed later. The rest should look familiar to anyone using Rails;
  it is exactly what we would have had in our routes file. Now, from 
  <code>/deployment/systemone/railsapp_one/config/routes.rb</code>, we can do this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1051313.js?file=jsuchy-20081202-11.rb"></script>
<p>
  In order to invoke the Proc object stored in <code>serverconfig.rb</code>, we just send the call
  message to the Proc stored in the configuration hash, if it exists. In our implementation, we invoke
  the Proc configured in <code>serverconfig.rb</code> before all of the other (default) routes, with
  the assumption that the configured routes should have the highest priority. If we run into a case where
  this isn’t the case, we can address that problem then.
</p>
