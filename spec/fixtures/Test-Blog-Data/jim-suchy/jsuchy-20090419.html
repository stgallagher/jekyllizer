  Today turned out to be little coding and quite a bit of retrospective. I was able
  to pair with Nate Jackson for a little bit on the iPhone application that he’s
  working on. I also tested a Webrat patch on a brand new Rails application via
  a cucumber test to wrap that up.

  Over some excellent Greek food, we had an informal retrospective. A few
  notes from the discussion:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The duration of the swap seems just about right. As Dave said, the law of 
    diminishing returns likely kicks in after a few days or a week, and the cost of
    another week would likely outweigh the benefits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kevin Taylor brought up the idea of more planning in response to my admission that
    I was a bit nervous Monday morning. The source of my nervousness was really due to
    not knowing exactly what to expect. I think that the lack of planning was actually
    extremely beneficial to the flow of the week. I was able to pair with many different
    people, and the flow between pairs was very organic and natural. Having a plan to follow
    probably would have changed this dynamic for the worse.
  </li>
  <li>
    The feeling that the swap was successful was unanimous. We all felt that we benefitted
    from my being onsite for the past week. I knew that I was learning a ton and having a
    great experience, but I was extremely happy to hear similar feelings vocalized by the Obtivians.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This was an absolutely fantastic experience. It gave me a chance to step away
  from client work for an entire week and explore new technologies, techniques and
  ideas, work with different people, and learn a lot.
</p> 
<p>
  I believe that both 8th Light and Obtiva have compared this time away from
  client work to spending a week at a conference. From my experience this past
  week, this was better than any conference I’ve attended.
</p> 
<p>
  Listening to speakers talk about new ideas is one thing; actually pairing with
  great developers and learning hands-on is in a different league.
