<p>  
  This week is a big one for the 8th Light team. Let’s head through the highlights:
</p>

<h3>Agile 2009</h3>

<p>
  As usual a large number of 8th Lighters will be participating at Agile 2009. 
  This is always a fun and educational experience for us, and this year it’s in our 
  hometown. Let’s go through the talks we’re giving:
</p>

<p>
  Mission Impossible: TDD and Javascript In the New Orleans room on Tuesday at 11:00
  Jim Suchy will be giving a talk on doing TDD in Javascript. Javascript is a language 
  that people tend to claim is “untestable” or “not worth it” but Jim will be showing 
  that testing is not only possible, but worthwhile. In addition he demonstrates some 
  of the neat features that make Javascript a cool language.
</p>

<p>
  Ruby Kata and Sparring Back in the New Orleans room on Thursday at 9:45, Micah Martin 
  will be talking about Ruby Kata and Sparring. Everybody wants to be a great developer, 
  but how do you do it? Micah will show two different practice techniques, kata’s and 
  sparring. If you go to this talk you get to judge the speaker and tell him how well he
  codes. How often do you get to do that?
</p>

<p>
  TDD on iPhone The Eric’s are giving their legendary talk on practicing TDD on the iPhone 
  on Thursday from 2:00 - 3:30 in Grand Ballroom F. This time we have a special surprise 
  for those who attend - a Randori coding session where you will code functioning iPhone 
  application. Please wash your hands before attending, as you’ll be using my keyboard. 
  Head to my <a href="https://github.com/paytonrules">github</a> page to see a sneak preview of what we’ll be working on.
</p>

<p>
  Live Aid Once again some 8th Light guys will be helping out with Live Aid, including 
  our newest Craftsman Colin Jones. Come to the stage, write some Rails, help charity. 
  10 minutes or 10 hours it doesn’t matter. Experience in Rails or even web development 
  are unnecessary - that’s what the mentors are there for.
</p>

<h3>chiPhone</h3>

<p>
  The second meeting of chiPhone, the Chicago iPhone developer group, will be held at a special 
  location this week: the Obtiva offices! Thursday night if you’d like to do some hacking head to the 
  <a href="http://chiphonegroup.org/">chiPhone</a> 
  website to register - or just show up. I only need to count so I order the right amount of pizza.
</p>  

<h3>SCNA America</h3>

<p>
  I saved the best for last. 
  <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship</a> 
  North America is a joint effort by 8th Light and Obtiva and frankly it has the 
  <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/speakers">best speaker lineup</a> 
  I’ve ever seen. Registrations are still available and cheap! If I could take credit for this I 
  would - but it really goes to the organizers, who did a fantastic job. The entire 8th Light 
  staff well be there and available for discussion, questions, and to accept free beer from the 
  attendees. Meanwhile two of us will be speaking:
</p>  

<p>
  The Business of Craftsmanship “Craftsmanship sounds expensive!” If you’ve heard similar 
  comments from your supervisors or clients, then join Micah, Kevin Taylor and Carl Erickson, 
  three experienced craftsmen-turned-entrepreneurs for this 30 minute panel discussion. All 
  three panelists come from technical backgrounds and have built successful software development 
  companies that are built on craftsmanship values, such as quality, learning, and community, 
  and use Extreme Programming practices to develop software.
</p>

<p>
  Apprenticing to Mastery Listen to Paul and Obtiva’s Dave Hoover discuss how an Apprenticeship
  program can benefit your company and your career. Software companies are always looking for 
  ways to develop skilled developers. Formal software apprenticeship is the approach taken by 
  more and more companies, including Obtiva and 8th Light. Over the past 2 years we have observed
  almost a dozen apprenticeships and come to recognize certain apprenticeships of developers that 
  are themed by their aspiration to mastery.
</p>  

<p>
  This might be the biggest week in 8th Light history - hope to see you there!
