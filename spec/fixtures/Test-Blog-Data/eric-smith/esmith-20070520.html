<h1>Lost in Portland, and Thinking</h1>

	Did I say I was tired yesterday? That wasn’t tired, <i>this</i> is tired. I’m currently training 
	for the marathon, and today I was scheduled for a 13 mile run. Sadly marathon training does not wait 
	for RailsConf so I was up at five this morning, viewing the fair city of Portland. Say what you will 
	about running, but it’s a great way to see a new city.
</p>
<p>
	It’s also a great way to get lost. I used the great website at USA track and field where people post 
	their runs in order to find a place to go and promptly wrote down a street name incorrectly. I ended 
	up wandering around Portland’s lovely Willamette river, which fortunately provides a great landmark 
	for a poor lost tourist. This led to running, and running, and running…and finally a Runners High.
</p>	
<p>
	Runners High is a phenomenon cause by your brain releasing endorphins, as a defense mechanism against 
	the way your body feels. When I run my brain feels extremely active, and jumps from topic to topic 
	making associations, breaking down problems, etc. It’s not unheard of for me to fix a bug I’d been 
	struggling with while on a run, in a sudden burst of insight. Today, when I wasn’t wondering where 
	the hell I was, I started thinking about quite a few things one of which is related to the new IDE’s 
	being developed and the barrier to entry on Rails. Bear with me because this is a little out there, 
	and I haven’t quite figured out how to articulate the concepts.
</p>
<p>
	Right now Ruby and Rails are still strange and unusual things to most developers. When introduced to 
	the language they want an IDE, and upon hearing there is no visual debugger or that they have to use 
	Textmate, Eclipse or god-forbid emacs they turn away. They stick with Java or C++ and wizards and 
	comfortable development, and will wait until they need to use Ruby.
</p>
<p>
	Then one day their boss hears about Rails. They tell the developer, ‘you should be using this!’ and 
	so he goes and he gets an IDE, real slick one with lot’s of bells and whistles. He goes to generate 
	a model - only he doesn’t use script/generate. He uses a wizard, he sees he can add his methods and 
	data members right there, so he does. Test? What test? Then he goes to the controller and has his 
	controller manipulate the data all day, and develops a view in a WYSIWYG editor. He spends all day 
	in the debugger, and his methods get bigger and bigger. Of course that’s no big deal, because he 
	uses cold folding to hide their size. Then testers write Test::Unit code to test his code, and he’s 
	done, because developers don’t test. Meanwhile we’ve all left Ruby because, “so much of the code is 
	crap.” Haven’t we done this cycle before?
</p>
<p>
	Chad Fowler described us as arrogant in the introduction, and clearly if you look above we are. I 
	say we because nobody reading this had a problem with my rant, so you’re just as arrogant as I am. 
	Caught you. We think we’re smarter than everybody else don’t we? Actually I don’t and most of you 
	probably don’t either. I just know that there is a right and wrong way to do things, and so does 
	Rails. That’s why it’s so opinionated. An attendee, 
	<a href="http://jackcanty.com/">Jack Canty</a>, put it better than I can by saying “Rails is 
	opinionated, and this takes away those opinions.”
</p>
<p>
	So how do we fix it? Well let me steal some of Micah’s DSL thunder by using an analogy I 
	thought of while running. It’s morning, and you want a coffee. So you go to a certain 
	ubiquitous chain and say, “I’d like a big coffee please,” only said ubiquitous chain doesn’t 
	have big. They have Tall, Grande and Venti. If you do this there will be a noticeable pause 
	while the guy behind the counter takes a second to think about what you just said. He’s not 
	a moron, take off his green smock and he knows what a big coffee is, but he’s got to translate 
	it. What’s big - is it grande? Venti? That’s because you’re not speaking his language. You 
	eventually do get your coffee, because he can figure out what you mean, but it takes just a 
	little bit longer. While you wait in line you hear other people say, “I’ll have a grande 
	half-caf no-foam latte,” and the guy behind the counter immediately repeats it. Eventually 
	you learn the language they speak, and you get your coffee just a little bit faster. You’ve 
	adapted to the idioms of the coffee shop, and you’ve been rewarded for it.
</p>
<p>
	So what the heck does that have to do with code? I kind of gave it away by using the phrase 
	idioms, didn’t I? Well let’s say you’re a C++ programmer and you start on Ruby. You don’t 
	write Unit Tests, which despite what we sometimes think most developers do NOT do, and you 
	sit down to iterate through an array. So you write:
</p>
<!-- 
index = 0
while index < array.length do
  puts index
end 
-->
<p>
	Much like ordering a big coffee at the Green Angel, that will work, but it’s completely incorrect. 
	It’s not speaking Ruby even if it’s in the Ruby language, and unfortunately I believe that if we 
	do not work hard to enforce and teach the best practices of the Rails and Ruby ways, we will 
	witness this kind of thing propagated. I’ve done the C++ without test thing and lived in the 
	debugger, and it drove me nuts. Unfortunately <i>many developers don’t think anything is wrong 
	with that</i>. If they did they’d be here already. That’s what programming is to them. The 
	good news is that we are the early adopters, and when they come around they will adapt to 
	our rules but only if we make them. Remember what I said about the pause at Starbucks? Well 
	the code above won’t pause. Ruby will execute it just as nicely as anything else, and maybe 
	it shouldn’t, I’m not sure. What I do know is that the IDE’s now being created should not be 
	catering to the developer that wants to do the things the way they’ve always done them. 
	Instead of opening ‘choices’ up and making things ‘easier’, our IDEs should enforce the 
	opinions of Rails. You see the late adopters aren’t lazy, or stupid, they’re just being 
	rewarded improperly. If it’s easy to make a model without tests, they’ll make one, even if 
	they are hurt by it later on. They’ll even stay until 1 AM to debug it, and their boss will 
	think ‘gosh this Rails thing isn’t so great after all, thank God my programmers are so 
	dedicated.’ Fortunately we control this. There’s a reason the IDE makers are here, and that’s 
	because they know that late adopters ask the early adopters what they use. Tell the IDE 
	makers that you want an IDE that does not allow bad habits. I want an IDE that is integrated 
	with subversion, but I also want it to yell at me if I have untested code, and run ZenTest. 
	If it gives me a wizard the first question it should ask is “what is the name of the test?.” 
	Instead of code folding to hide bad code, it should identify refactoring opportunities. 
	Finally, I’m not sure I even want a debugger. Debugging sucks, and it’s a crutch. I can test 
	behavior rather than step through it and look at it. I realize people do want debuggers, I 
	just worry for the day when Rails code can’t be properly understood without stepping through it.
</p>
<p>
	Tell the IDE developers that you want an IDE that helps create good code, not easy code. If 
	they don’t do that, then when developers ask you what you use say emacs. If the developer 
	still turns away, we probably aren’t losing much.
