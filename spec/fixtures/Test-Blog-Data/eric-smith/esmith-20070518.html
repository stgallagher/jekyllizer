<h1>Day Two at RailsConf</h1>
<p id="author">Eric Smith</p>

<p>
	Hello again from RailsConf. I’ve gone through five presentations. I don’t have any enormous 
	revelations, and no good pictures yet, but I do have some observations. I’ll do this Larry 
	King style.
</p>
<p>
	…Uncle Bob and Jim Weirich are great public speakers. I’ve seen Uncle Bob do most of the 
	CleanCode talk before, and I’ll go again at Agile 2007…Went for a run yesterday, Portland is 
	quite pretty…Everyone I’ve met here has been unfailingly interesting, with nobody trying to 
	‘network’ just meet people like normal human beings…Spider Man 3 was mildly disappointing 
	…If you get a chance to download the slides from Spam I Have Known, do so. Hugely entertaining…
	If you add videos to your presentation it’s fun, but not as much fun as genuine enthusiasm 
	about your topic.
</p>
<p>
	Okay I can’t do that for very long, how did Larry do it for 20 years? The highlights from 
	today would have to be three things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Keynote. The tone here is very different from your typical stuffy conference, and it’s great. 
		Chad Fowler playing the ukulele, DHH referring to ‘unicorns’, I doubt you see these at a 
		Windows Vista conference. Well you probably do, but it’s forced and trite. There’s a genuine 
		enthusiasm here, because what we have here are 1600 developers who are all passionate craftsman 
		who would do this for free. To any potential customers: That last part was a joke. We like to 
		be paid. Speaking of paying, Dave Thomas gave a talk (which Gilberto attended) on Rails for 
		charity, and that charity is still open at: http://pragmaticstudio.com/dontate
	</li>
</ul>	
<p>
	Charity good, give some.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Clean Code. Uncle Bob is a “friend of the program” as they say in college and rather closely 
		related to my boss, so my opinion is biased admittedly, but his speech today was packed and 
		as always well received. If you want to see what he talked about hold the apple or ctrl key 
		and click http://www.objectmentor.com. That will open the site in a new window, so you don’t 
		go away.
	</li>
	<li>
		Spam I have known. The presentations I saw the rest of the day were up/and/down. Nothing was 
		bad exactly, and I know these people put a lot of effort into them so I won’t name names, but 
		there wasn’t much memorable. I was beginning to think I’d have to make up something to blog 
		today, until seeing Jim Weirich’s presentation on spam. Ruse has a really nice algorithm for 
		detecting spam which has quite a few features but it centers around an idea so obvious you’ll 
		wish you’d thought of it, the Tarpit. Spammers routinely defeat sites with one thing - feedback! 
		They attack a site trying different things until they figure out why they were rejected. A 
		Tarpit takes spam and doesn’t give them an error message, it puts it in the Tarpit. They think 
		that their spam was successful, so they don’t change the spam. I think I’m going to grab it 
		and try it for my personal wiki, which has never been replaced since I left the evils of 
		corporate America.
