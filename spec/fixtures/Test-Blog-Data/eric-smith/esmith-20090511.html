<h2>
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> on the iPhone is a challenging 
  experience, especially when you’ve been spoiled by Ruby like I have been, but it 
  can be done.  I have a tutorial in the works for getting started, but in the 
  meantime I’ll be writing bits and pieces about my experience.  The first was 
  <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2009/4/16/dependency-inversion-principle-and-iphone">here</a> 
  and this is the second.  Test cases are written using the 
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/">Google Toolbox for Mac</a>.  
  This particular example is about the NSTimer.

<h3>It keeps going and going</h3>
<p>
  The app to your right is a simple app for experimentation purposes that runs 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.  
  It has two buttons: advance and start.  Advance moves one generation ahead each time 
  you press it, whereas Start keeps advancing generations until you touch Stop.  To 
  implement that we use an NSTimer object which is programmed to call advance on the 
  game object.  The design is simple, shown here:

  The GameRunner creates an NSTimer, the NSTimer sends the message to Game.  Great but 
  how do we test it?  The less I know about something the more I tend to test it, which 
  means I tend to write smaller and smaller tests.  Let’s look at my first few tests of 
  the GameRunner object:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-1.m"></script>
<p>
  We’ve got some basic tests of creation.  At this point I was stumped.  I couldn’t 
  check the other parameters of the timer, because they weren’t public variables, so 
  at this point the code that actually created the timer looked like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-2.m"></script>
<p>
  That doesn’t really help me does it?  I have a timer with an interval, but it won’t 
  call anything when it’s triggered.  This is about the time I got to pair with Jake 
  Scruggs during the Craftsman Swap, which he’s written about 
  <a href="http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2009/04/fourth-day-of-craftsman-swap.html">here</a>.  
  It went badly, somewhat embarrassingly for me since I’m supposed to be the expert, 
  however we learn from failure.  Let’s look at some of the steps Jake and I took that 
  didn’t quite get us there.
</p>
<p>
  The first pass on the test was simple.  We needed a mock game, and it needed to have 
  its advanceGeneration method called (Ed. note:  I realize they aren’t called methods 
  in Obj-C, to which I say: bite me.) each turn.  Let’s try the brute force approach:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-3.m"></script>
<p>
  I’m writing the original tests from memory, so I make the occasional error here, but 
  it doesn’t matter since we got this wrong.  This test here seemed the most logical.  
  We ran the test and it failed, yea!  Then we updated the code:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-4.m"></script>
<p>
  Experienced Cocoa developer’s have already discovered our error, please don’t ruin 
  it for the rest of the readers.  So after changing the code we run the test and&hellip; 
  we fail.  So from here Jake and I figured it out.  Sleep won’t work because it stops 
  the entire application, including the run loop that calls our timer, so we’ll just 
  have to get the info out of the timer another way.  We’re interested in testing that 
  we’ve setup the timer correctly, and can trust that the timer just works.  After a 
  loooong time browsing documentation we figured it out.  We could call this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-5.m"></script>
<p>
  This will fire the timer and validate that it is setup correctly.  So we did this, 
  our test passed, we ran the app and it….failed.  We <em>knew</em> the timer was 
  executing because our test was passing, but when we ran the real app it just didn’t 
  do it.  Stumped and frustrated we stopped for the day.  Then time passed&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday I had a candidate in for an apprenticeship position, and we attempted to 
  solve the same problem.  We re-evaluated the test and decided calling fire directly 
  was cheating.  We looked into a half-dozen other ways to test this and learned about 
  the NSRunLoop.  Too much coding in Windows had rotted my brain, the run loop in 
  Objective-C is not the same as the one in Windows.  Specifically the current run loop 
  is accessible as an object.  We wrote a new test:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-6.m"></script>
<p>
  It’s not perfect - the 0.30 relies on the hard coded default interval of 0.25, and 
  that is too long, but it failed!  In the process of learning about NSRunLoop we also 
  realized I used the wrong method.  The working code is this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1057363.js?file=esmith-20090511-7.m"></script>
<p>
  See the word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; in front of Timer?  That actually adds the 
  timer to the default run loop.  Now we ran our spec, ran our actual code, and it 
  works!  The moral of the story?  Well if you’re persistent enough you can get your 
  code under test, and if your test is correct then your code will work.
