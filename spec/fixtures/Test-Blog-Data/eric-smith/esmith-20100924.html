  After 3 long years of searching, and several rejections (you know who you are), 
  I finally have an apprentice. I’ve asked him to blog every day on his apprenticeship, 
  and since I don’t like asking people to do things I won’t do I’ll also be blogging 
  about my first experience as a mentor 
  <a href="http://myfirstapprentice.tumblr.com/">here</a>. That’s not to say I won’t 
  also blog here, but the daily entries will be over at the tumblr.

  His blog is at 
  <a href="http://blog.degutis.org/">http://blog.degutis.org/</a>.
