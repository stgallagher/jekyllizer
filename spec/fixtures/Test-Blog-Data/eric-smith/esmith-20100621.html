  Today was day one of my Craftsmanswap with eLabs developer Anders Tornqvist, and so far 
  they have treated me with the hospitality and graciousness I expected. Largely they’ve 
  been led by my pair, pictured at right. This is Pixie, who’s been working in the same 
  room as me all day, and when she hasn’t been barking at me she’s been growling. It’s been 
  a tad….terrifying? Especially when the blood is dripping from her teeth, and she can leap 
  so high!
</p>

<p>
  Actually poor Pixie had a rough time of it last night, and it apparently led to her being 
  out of sorts. She eventually got along with me just fine, and I was able to have a productive 
  day pairing with Ingemar. I hope I was helpful, as I’m trying to spend most of my time listening. 
  I hate being the guy who shows up on a project and immediately tells people how to do stuff, 
  plus Ingemar had a grumpy boxer/pit-bull mix next to him so I wasn’t gonna ruffle feathers. 
  The problem with that approach is that you can end up failing to contribute by being too passive, 
  but I think I did okay today. Tomorrow I’ll probably be a little more vocal, and moreso the next 
  day. You know, just in time for me to leave.

<p>
  The highlight of our day, for me anyway, was implementing drag and drop in JQuery. I’ve never 
  done it before - I think I’ve done it in Prototype but it’s been a while - and it’s amazing 
  what a breeze it was. I’m going to have to find an excuse to use JQuery more, and I’ll probably 
  try and find out some info on ScrewUnit. Of course on the plane I started reading “Growing Object 
  Oriented Software, Guided by Tests” and a new iPhone book, so I’m nothing if not capable of 
  overbooking myself. Speaking of which GOOS looks like a real winner, if you didn’t already know.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to some JQuery at one point or another Ingemar touched on a gem or idiom I wasn’t 
  familiar with, often with me hurriedly scribbling notes probably without him realizing it. 
  The list of gems from today alone was:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>formtastic</li>
  <li>hitch</li>
  <li>machinist</li>
  <li>launchy</li>
  <li>carrierwave</li>
</ul>  

<p>
  Hitch was seriously cool, allowing us to push git changes as a pair. Formtastic is an interesting 
  form builder, and although we had some struggles with it today Ingemar assures me it’s awesome. 
  It did have a nice DSL syntax. We used machinist’s blueprint feature for building factory objects, 
  kinda like factory girl. I admit I like the concise syntax, but I wonder if we should be making 
  it easier to create lots of objects in setup for a test. Launchy cleanly launched the browser 
  when testing at a given point, and finally I’m excited to use carrierwave for file uploads tomorrow.

<p>
  I have more notes, particularly regarding the different way that eLabs does standups, but I fear 
  this blog post has become disjointed and a tad dull, so I shall leave you until tomorrow.
