<p>
  It’s with great pleasure that I announce the creation of chiPhone, the Chicago iPhone 
  developer’s group, with our first meeting on July 23rd at 6:30. The fourth Thursday 
  of every month should feature interesting presentations, hackfests, and everything 
  else you’d expect from a quality developer group.
</p>

<p>
  The group website is now up and running at 
  <a href="http://www.chiphonegroup.org/">www.chiphonegroup.org</a> where you can 
  register there to attend the first meetup. FIn addition you’ll find directions to 
  the 8th Light offices, where most of our meetings will take place, and the announcement
  of the topic for the next meeting. As the official site website all further information 
  will be posted there, including video recording of the talks.
</p>

<p>
  The first meeting will feature a presentation by “the Eric’s” on Test Driven Development 
  for the iPhone. We’ll be starting with the basics of setup and work all the way through 
  Dependency Injection using Interface Builder. Bring your Macs so you can grab our github 
  project for experimenting. Get to the 8th Light offices early for pizza and refreshments.
</p>

<p>
  8th Light is located just off of Route 45 in Libertyville, and detailed directions are 
  available on the chiPhone website. In addition we are near the Libertyville train station, 
  just <a href="mailto:eric@8thlight.com">email me</a> if you need to arrange to be picked up.
</p>

<p>
  I’m looking forward to a lot of great meetups, and I’ll be asking 
  <i>you</i> to provide some topics in the near future.
