<h1>Stubbing :new Considered Harmful</h1>

<h1>Hi my name is Eric, and I have made a mess.</h1>

<p>
There I said it. I’m not proud of it, but I believe a couple very loosely related things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You only learn from your mistakes</li>
  <li>Everybody makes mistakes, a craftsman cleans them up.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is in the process of cleaning up the mess that I’ve been trying to evaluate the messy 
  code in the first place. How is the code messy? Was it Test-Driven? It was - or at least 
  it attempted to be (we’ll get back to that). Was I lazy? Certainly not. Am I stupid? Crap 
  I hope not. So how did we end up in this mess?
</p>

<h3>What’s the mess nimrod?</h3>

<p>
  Recently Justin, our latest apprentice, wrote about attending a code review 
  <a href="http://8thlightapprenticeship.blogspot.com/2010/01/day-13.html">
  here. The feature he is referring to is part of one of our best client’s systems, where we 
  integrated with several webservices, making them look seamless in our application. This was 
  an extremely difficult problem, and our code bent in a dozen painful ways for a solution, and 
  has since become rigid. Changes have stopped being done in the nice Test-Code-Refactor mode, 
  and instead are being done by trying a change, trying the product, then backing out the change 
  and making the test pass. While we identified several ways to improve the code, such as better 
  naming and adding a facade between some of our interfaces, one stated goal was to “make the 
  tests readable.” See the problem isn’t that it’s not tested - it’s that you can’t follow the 
  tests at all. Let’s look at an example, modified to protect the guilty:
</p>  

<!-- Ruby

  it "should call a webservice when its complete" do
    @caller.should_receive(:call_webservice)
    typedObj = mock("Obj", :no_follow_ups? => false, :null_object => true)
    ProprietaryObject.stub!(:create_typed_obj).and_return(typedObj)

    @page.stub!(:widget_id).and_return(@widget.id)
    @page.stub!(:previous_page_id).and_return(nil)
    @product.page_cache = [@page]

    @widget.follow_ups({}, {:application_id => "123", :group => "group"})
  end
  
-->
 
<p>
  This probably isn’t the worst example - if you look closely you can see that we’re testing that 
  call_webservice needs to get called when ‘its complete.’ But what complete? I don’t see a stubbed 
  object that returns complete. Also I have no idea what @page, @widget, @product or :create<em>type</em>dobj 
  are doing here. When I want to write the next test I have to guess at intent, and start playing 
  with variables. What this is trying to test is that a webservice caller object receives call_webservice 
  when the widget (an object on the screen) is called with certain variables. I’d tell you what 
  those variables are, but I truly don’t know.
</p>

<p>
  It doesn’t get better. Let’s look at where some of those variables are coming from. These are 
  excerpts from a setup method that is too long.*
</p>  

<!-- Ruby

  Context.stub!(:find_by_widget_and_application_form).and_return(@context)
  Page.stub!(:new).and_return(@page)
  ...
  @caller = mock('caller', :call_webservice => nil)
  WebserviceCaller.stub!(:new).and_return(@caller) 
  ...
  @page_factory = mock_model(PageFactory, :acquire => @page)
  PageFactory.stub!(:new).and_return(@page_factory)
  
-->  
  
<p>
  So by my count we’ve stubbed new three times, two finders, and an acquire all of which inject yet 
  another dependency into the code. Thus the premise of the article <i>stubbing new considered harmful</i>.
</p>  

<h3>Is it really harmful?</h3>

<p>
  Dependencies in static languages are generally more onerous than what we’ve got here, sometimes 
  extremely painful although usually it can be accomplished with simple setters and constructors. 
  In Ruby this isn’t the case - you can just stub new and create the object the way the user intended, 
  thereby continuing to test. This can be a VERY BAD THING because it’s a moment where you need to 
  pause. Do you need this dependency? Should you be wrapping dependencies? Do you need a facade or wrapper 
  object for a couple dependencies? The difficulty of DI in other languages enforces that pause, but Ruby 
  does not. It lets you stub anything, only to one day wonder why you have such a mess on your hands.
</p>

<p>
  It’s important to remember that Dependency Inversion existed before Unit Testing, and isn’t just a Unit 
  Testing technique. Indeed we often sell TDD as a way to make you have better designs, and yet here it 
  failed me because I can so simply call new and continue testing. This is a mistake. To paraphrase Jurassic 
  Park, just because you can easily stub new doesn’t mean you should. Would you create a constructor that 
  took five objects? Then why would you stub :new (or finders, or factory methods) five times. Would you pass 
  in an object to the constructor that’s only used in one method? No - that’s not cohesive. By stubbing :new 
  you can slowly, and easily, introduce dependency after dependency creating an indecipherable mess despite 
  writing tests. Worse you can do this easily, without suffering the traditional pain of tightly coupled 
  code. It’s only later that you’ll feel the awful, horrible, indescribable pain. Trust me it’s bad.
</p>

<p>
  Am I really advocating stopping stubbing :new? No not really. It makes perfect since to just call :new 
  when you can, and in many cases factories are a way to get around the limitations of a static language. 
  What I am saying is that each time you do stub!(:new) THINK! You have a dependency to manage, so manage it. 
  It’s your job you know.

<blockquote>
  Don’t use [SetUp] and [TearDown] to initialize or destroy objects that aren’t shared throughout the test 
  class in all the tests, because it makes the tests less understandable. Someone reading your code won’t 
  know which tests use the logic inside the setup method and which don’t.
