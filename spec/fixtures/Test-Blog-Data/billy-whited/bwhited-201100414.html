<h1>A Tale of Two Forms (Part 1)</h1>
<p id="author">Billy Whited</p>
<p id="date">2011-04-07</p>

<p>
  A few weeks ago, my co-workers asked me to demonstrate how to convert a form built using HTML 
  table elements into a more meaningful form structured with semantic HTML. Given the accessibility 
  issues that affect table-based forms, I was more than happy to oblige.
</p>
<p>
  Just to be clear, I don't think that "tables are evil." I actually feel quite the opposite. Tables 
  have their place—they are absolutely fantastic for marking up tabular data like train schedules, 
  stock quotes, spreadsheets and etceteras (which is what they were actually intended for.)
</p>
<p>
  However, given their inherent grid-like structure, tables are sometimes used to lend a scaffolding to 
  other elements like forms and divs that are inherently unstructured. Using tables in this way is an 
  abuse and runs counter to the widely accepted notion that we, as web designers and developers, should 
  strive to isolate our structural (HTML), presentational (CSS), and behavioral (Javascript) components.
</p>
<h3>Why Tables Are Inappropriate For Forms</h3>
<p>
  Using tables to mark up forms is inappropriate for a few reasons:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marking up forms with tables adds unnecessary markup and decreases maintainability.</li>
    <li>
      Inserting form elements like labels and inputs in separate table cells erodes the fundmental 
      relationships otherwise defined by their proximity to one another. This prevents users who rely on 
      screen readers or other assistive devices from efficiently navigating your form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tables are devices intended for information output, while forms are intended form information 
      input.This is a fundamental inconsistency.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Why You Should Build A More Semantic Form</h3>
<p>
  There are several HTML elements that are specifically intended for use inside of forms and you should 
  always make it a point to use them. Some of these elements include: divs, labels, and inputs. Here are 
  a couple advantages of using them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Labels and inputs have an explicit, meaningful relationship. Placing these elements next to each other 
    in your form will help to better convey the meaning of your document to web crawlers, screen readers and 
    other assistive devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using divs to group related items (i.e. labels and inputs) will cutdown on the amount of code needed to 
    markup a form. What's more, divs were expressly intended to group related content and using them in 
    appropriate fashion will improve the semantics of your document which, in turn, improves your SEO.
  </li>  
  <li>
    By applying CSS intelligently, you can use these elements to construct a form that can take almost any 
    shape—with less code. Furthermore, by separating structure from presentation, you can make your form more 
    maintainable so changes to your layout merely require an adjustment to your CSS (rather than an adjustment 
    to your CSS and your HTML).
  </li>
</ul>
