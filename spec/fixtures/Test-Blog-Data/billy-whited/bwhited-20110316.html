  In a web saturated with numerous opinion blogs, gallery showcases, tutorial sites
  and technical references, where should an aspiring web developer seek knowledge 
  about the basics of web design? Which resources are signal? Which are noise?
</h2>
<p>
  If you are just starting to expand your design awareness&mdash;and you don't have 
  the luxury of being plugged into a network of savvy designers&mdash;it can really be
  difficult to determine where to look, what to read, and who to listen to.
</p>
<p>
  In my first two weeks working at 8th Light, several of my developer colleagues have
  expressed interest in learning more about the wizardry that goes into the front-end:
  whether they've been perplexed by an unfamiliar piece of software, or impressed by
  the structure of a well-formatted style sheet.
</p>
<p>
  So, I thought it would be a good idea to share some of the resources I've collected
  over the yearsâ€”resources that I keep coming back to, again and again, for aesthetic,
  technical, or ethical guidance.
</p>
<p>
  The following list isn't exhaustive, but it will provide a jumping off point for those
  developers looking to heighten their design IQs:
</p>
<h3>Books on Design</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.jnd.org/books.html#33">The Design of Everyday Things</a> by Donald Norman</h4>
<p>
  This book provides profound insights into the nature of human computer/device/interface/object
  interaction and I recommend reading it at the start of your journey. By highlighting 
  frequently overlooked principles of humane design, Norman ensures that you'll never look at,
  think about, or interact with your surroundings in the same way again.

<h4>
  <a href="http://fivesimplesteps.com/books/practical-guide-designing-for-the-web">
  A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web</a> 
  by Mark Boulton
</h4>
<p>
  A concise and well written introduction to the many components of web design including:
  research, color, typography, layout, grids, and more. This book will improve your aesthetic
  sensibilities and grant you an appreciation for the multifaceted enterprise that is design.
</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Thinking with Type</a> by Ellen Lupton</h4>
<p>
  Typography is the most essential component of any graphic design (either for web or print).
  Difficult to master, its often overlooked by new designers who tend to focus on improving 
  their photoshop skills. Don't make this mistake. Read this book and open yourself up to a 
  new way of seeing.
</p>
<h3>Technical Resources</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a></h4>
<p>
  A website stocked full with well-curated and peer-reviewed articles written by some of the
  most prominent names in web design and development. Topics range from the technical to the
  ethical. Bookmark or subscribe to keep pace with the fast moving industry you've chosen 
  work in.
</p>
<h4>
  <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">
    Opera: Web Standards Curriculum
  </a>
</h4>
<p>
  Web design is holistic enterprise. I believe that to do good work designers must be able 
  to read, write and thoroughly understand semantic, well-structured HTML and CSS. The Opera
  Web Standards Curriculum is free, updated frequently, and filled with great tutorials.
</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a></h4>
<p>
  Today's graphics editors are as complicated as space-ships and as difficult to learn. With
  high-production values and excellent course design, the video tutorials on Lynda.com will
  allow you to achieve a basic competency with your chosen graphics editor in a short 
  period of time.
</p>
<h3>Websites for Inspiration</h3>
<h4><a href="http://ffffound.com/">FFFFound!</a></h4>
<p>
  It's a good practice to seek inspiration from other creative realms like advertising, 
  photography and visual art. FFFFound! is photographic stream of the stuff. It's a beautiful
  cornucopia. Go get lost in it!
</p>
<h4><a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a></h4>
<p>
  Innovative sharing space for 400 x 300px screenshots of sketches, illustrations, digital artwork,
  typography, icons and many other nameless things. Some of the worlds the world's best designers
  and digital artists belong to this invite only site, so the quality of the work remains 
  unusually high.
</p>
<h4><a href="http://siteinspire.net/">Site Inspire</a></h4>
<p>
  The web is saturated with so called "galleries" that purport to exhibit the best work on the web.
  However, most of these sites showcase designs that merely follow the latest trends. Site Inspire,
  on the other hand, consistently exhibits websites that buck familiar design trends.
</p>
<h3>Applications for Productivity</h3>
<h4>Ommwriter</h4>
<p>
  Writing is a crucial part of interface design, but it's a laborious process. And while no tool can
  make you a better writer, Ommwriter makes it easier to focus on the task by removing the distractions
  of traditional word processors.
</p>
<h4>xScope</h4>
<p>
  When I encounter the need to measure an element on-screen, establish an alignment grid, or grab the 
  hexcode for an appealing color, I count on xScope to do the job quickly and easily. It's a major 
  time saver.
</p>
<h4>Things</h4>
<p>
  I have a tendency to forget things. Rather than trying to keep track of everything I need to get done
  in my head, I rely on Things. It frees up brain power so I can focus on the stuff that matters: like
  the tasks at hand.

  400% of his $25,000 goal.
