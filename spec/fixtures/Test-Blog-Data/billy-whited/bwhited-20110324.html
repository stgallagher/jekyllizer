  <h3>Add Meta Information</h3>
  <blockquote>
    "...there is a huge likelihood that the systems will evolve from lower to higher 
    entropy, which is a rough statement of the second law of thermodynamics." — Brian Greene
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Without a scaffold, CSS has the tendency to grow like an untamed garden during the development 
    process. To begin designing a scaffold for your styles, it's helpful to make comparisons between 
    your stylesheet and a book.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much like stylesheets, books are descriptive narratives that rely on a strict organizational 
    scheme in order to make sense. So it follows that—just as books use a "table of contents" to 
    allow for easy navigation between sections—we too can generate a system that allows us more 
    easily navigate and maintain our CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the top of each stylesheet, I list meta-information about the stylesheet itself and provide 
    a table of contents that will help other designers understand the structure of my markup. My 
    list usually includes these items:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Author</li>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Table of Contents</li>
    <li>Important Colors</li>
  </ul>  
<!-- CSS
/*

Title: application.css

Author(unless otherwise noted): billy@8thlight.com

Description: This is the main stylesheet for www.inserturlhere.com

Contents:

1. =R ESET
2. =G LOBAL
3. =T YPOGRAPHY
4. =S TRUCTURAL
5. =M EDIA QUERIES

rgb(255,143,27) — Orange

    By prepending an "=" sign to your content list entires, you can easily navigate between important 
    sub-sections of your stylesheet by using the "find" feature of your chosen editor. For example, 
    if you wanted to quickly navigate to the "typography" section, you would search for "=T."
  </p>

    <h3>Organize Property/Value Pairs</h3>
    <blockquote>
      "It's in the details that there is a spiritual power; I'd even risk calling it a soul." — Tom Sachs
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Craftsmanship is all about paying attention to details: meticulousness begets quality. I always make 
      it a point to alphabetize the property/value pairs inside my declaration blocks. Doing so makes it much 
      easier locate specific properties inside of long declaration blocks and adds a level of predictability 
      and usability to my stylesheets.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Of the two examples below, which do you think is easier to parse?
    </p>
    
<!--
/* Example One: Alphabetized Declarations */

p[role="complementary"] a {
	background-color: rgb(235,107,16);
	border: 2px solid rgb(69,64,61);
	color: rgb(255,255,255);	
	display: block;
        font-size: 1.2em;
	font-weight: bold;
	margin: 0 auto 1em auto;
	padding: 0.75em;
	text-align: center;
	text-decoration: none;
	text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
	width: 75%;
}

/* Example Two: Randomized Declarations */

p[role="complementary"] a {
        margin: 0 auto 1em auto;
        font-weight: bold;
	background-color: rgb(235,107,16);
        width: 75%;
        text-align: center;
	border: 2px solid rgb(69,64,61);
	color: rgb(255,255,255);	
	font-size: 1.2em;
	padding: 0.75em;
	text-decoration: none;
	text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
        display: block;
}

    <h3>Group Dependent Property/Value Pairs</h3>
    <p>
      We can take the organization of declaration blocks one step further by logically grouping dependent 
      property/value pairs. This is a technique I use sparingly so as not to disrupt the rhythm of my 
      markup, but I have found it helpful in two common situations: with positioning offsets and with 
      browser specific CSS3 declarations.
    </p>  
    <p>
      In the case of positioning, I feel that it makes sense to indent and group positioning offsets like 
      "top," "right," "bottom" and "left" underneath the property they're helping to define, in this case 
      "position." I often change the value of more than one offset at a time and to me it makes sense to 
      place them in the context of each other in the mark up.
    </p>
<!--
h1 + p:after {
	content: url(../images/birds-in-flight.png);
	position: absolute;
		right: -25%;
		top: 0;
	width: 10.7059em;
}

    <h3>Quarantine CSS3 Declarations</h3>
    <p>
      Browser specific CSS3 declarations tend to be unruly and visually disruptive so I make it habit to 
      quarantine them from the rest of my property/value pairs. I feel it also makes sense to separate these 
      styles so they are easier to update as browser begin to support them natively (in which case the browser 
      specific extensions can be dropped). Admittedly, when doing this you'll need to take the cascade into 
      account, but as a rule I find this technique to be a helpful time-saver.
    </p>
<!--
h1 + p {
	background: rgb(250,234,207);
	font-weight: normal;
	line-height: 1.3em;
	margin: 0 0 0 -2em;
	padding: 0.4286em 3em 0.4286em 2em;
	width: 75%;

        -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
        -moz-border-radius: 5px;
        border-radius: 5px;

	-webkit-box-shadow: 3px 3px 0px rgb(237,220,189);
	-moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 0px rgb(237,220,189);

    <h3>Format Declaration Blocks Consistently</h3>  
    <p>
      The way your format your stylesheet is largely a matter of personal preference—I have seen many 
      different approaches—but there is at least one rule that must be followed strictly: be consistent! 
      I format my declaration blocks following a simple method:
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are less than three property/value pairs, I keep the declaration block on a single line.
    </p>  
<!--
section footer { background: transparent; margin: 2em 0; padding: 0; }
view rawSingle-Line.cssThis Gist brought to you by GitHub.
-->
    <p>
      If there are more than three property/value pairs, I format the declaration block using multiple 
      lines.
    </p>
<!--
header a { 
	color: rgb(255,255,255);
	float: right; 
	font-size: 1.7em;
	font-weight: bold;
	line-height: 3em;

    <h3>Add Some Panache</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, a little trick I picked up from designer/front-end developer 
      <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>: 
      add a little panache to your stylesheet by including an ascii version of your client’s logo.

    While perhaps completely unnecessary, I've always felt that taking this extra step lends an air 
    of quality to your work. It's a memorable and surprising touch that says: I <i>care</i>.
