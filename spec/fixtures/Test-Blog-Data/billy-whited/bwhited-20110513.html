<h1>Found Type (and Graphics)</h1>

	A few weeks ago, I wrote an article about keeping 
	<a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/articles/2011/4/7/inspiration-catalog-a-k-a-morgue-file">inspiration catalogs</a>. 
	In an effort to demonstrate that I do—at least occasionally—practice what I preach, I thought I'd 
	share some examples of typography (and graphic design) that have recently caught my eye.
</p>
<p>
	It's worth mentioning that these samples were all captured while away from the computer (whether I 
	was out for a walk, in a store, making dinner, etc.) As a web designer, I am constantly forcing myself 
	to look for inspiration away from the web (it's not always as easy as it sounds). Doing so can help 
	you avoid stale [web] design trends, stay fresh and inspired, over come creative blocks and, if your 
	lucky or particularly curious, remain in a constant state of discovery (since leaving school, I've 
	found it a lot more difficult to do this.)
</p>
<p>
	And While I do believe that inspiration can be gleaned from online sources, one must be careful. After 
	awhile, I just find that it all begins to look the same.
</P>

	on the move with my iPhone, which is sort of the point.</i>

<h3>Found...on store shelves</h3>

	The tagline for this product is "Wake up call," a notion which I think the layout, color 
	and typography supports. As a man, I found the strength and upfront of nature of this design 
	appealing (perhaps the orange evokes an allusion to "construction worker"?). Surely it would 
	stand out among all of my wife's beauty products.

	The simplicity and beauty of this wine label appealed to my typographic sense. I found the 
	contrast between the bold, uppercase gothic lettering and the comparatively delicate, serifed 
	small caps to be delightful.

	I really appreciate simple, typographically sophisticated designs so it should come as no 
	surprise that I found this tea packaging to be quite elegant. It effectively communicates 
	its brand and purpose with 2 typefaces and few small, intelligently colored squares. Notice 
	how the saturation and color of each square aligns with the tea it's describing? Subtlety 
	at its finest.

<h3>Found...in the kitchen</h3>

<p>
	This happy accident occurred when I accidentally spilled water into a bowl of sesame oil. 
	I think its appeal is self-explanatory.

	A playful amalgam of texture and type. I always do a double take whenever I see Archer 
	Farms packaging, though I do feel this design could benefit slightly from a lightening of 
	the green lace background pattern. There's a bit of 
	<a href="http://meiert.com/en/blog/20070118/1-1-3-explaining-busyness-and-background-noise-on-websites/">
	1+1 = 3 or more</a> going on.

	This coffee packaging has always felt like a user interface to me. I'm always tempted to try 
	and toggle the "Flavor Intensity" of the beans and/or the roast time. Graphically, I think the 
	packaging is a nice demonstration of typographic hierarchy. Which phrases stand out the most to you? 
	What do you think their relative importance is?

<h3>Found...while walking the dog</h3>

	Way more sophisticated than your average construction company branding, I loved this sign 
	from head to toe (typography, color, layout.) Given the level of its sophistication, I was 
	not surprised to learn that it was placed on the building site of a future Leed (Green 
	Building) Certified Library.

<p>
	This highly visible sign says: BOOM! Buy a fence! With the exception of some 
	<a href="http://quotesondesign.com/frederic-goudy/">ill advised letter-spacing of the lower case</a>, 
	this design presents a sharp use of color with a clear, unmistakable visual hierarchy.

<p>
	In an era where public service signage seems ubiquitously set in Helvetica, I was pleased to happen 
	upon this fire hose sign which seems to be a holdout from a bygone era. Communicative without being 
	brash, the 
	<a href="http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/bergsland/humanist.html">humanist sans serif typeface</a> 
	the sign is set with has gentle, but alert, personality. The repetition apparent in the fire hose 
	graphic creates a visual oscillation that leads my eye to graphic focal point (the nozzle), which 
	in turn points to the sign's text. This is simply good design.
