  Michael Feathers recently wrote a blog about boutique software shops.</a>  He drew the 
  parallel between master chefs and software shops.  There were a few great points I would 
  like to respond to:
</h2>
<p>
  1.&ldquo;So, where are the high-end restaurants of software development? One place to 
  look is in the &ldquo;boutique software shops.&rdquo; I don’t know where I first heard 
  that term, but for me it is a &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; for all of the small software 
  development houses that I see springing up all over the place.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  This is an interesting phenomenon.  I am not sure if this has always happened or if I 
  am paying attention more to boutique shops now that I am a part of one.  8th Light is 
  an 8 craftsmen software shop that started in 2006 with the goal of writing high quality 
  software.  No teaching, coaching, staff augmentation.  Just writing software, with the 
  idea that focusing on proving quality has a high correlation to success.
</p>
<p>
  I agree with the high-end software shop analogy.  If you take a small team of trained 
  craftsmen focused on doing their best work, the result is most often a very strong 
  culture of quality.  Ramsay creates this strong culture of quality through a theatrical 
  performance of yelling and screaming at failure.  There are other ways for masters to 
  do the same thing.  Micah Martin, the 8th Light master craftsman, creates this strong 
  culture by setting an example of writing good code and holding yourself to a constantly 
  higher standard.  This is the common thread that I have seen through these boutique 
  shops–they all have an owner who is a technical leader who creates a strong culture 
  where (excuse the pun) failure is just not an option.  There are other similarities like 
  strong discipline, small teams, cutting edge technologies, and ability to develop strong 
  skill sets in developers, however, I think that all of these are direct descendants of 
  the strong leadership.

  2. &ldquo;It’s not that development teams need UX people, it’s more like UX teams need 
  developers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  I partially agree with Michael.  I think this statement can be replaced with any 
  critical specialization in the domain of software applications.  The reason UX is 
  getting a spotlight is because, as Michael notes, we have stuck UX on the back burner 
  for so long.  In the last few years though, the expectations from users of software 
  have luckily skyrocketed.  It is no longer okay to plow through features, but they 
  need to be simple, attractive, and intuitive.  When I worked with Gilberto Medrano 
  in 2005, he talked about the UX revolution that was coming.  In 2006, he created a 
  UX design while at 8th Light that continues to impress 3 years later (in web 
  application years, that is a lifetime).  Well, he was right, I can no longer stand 
  an application which is not aesthetically pleasing.  It doesn’t matter how cool the 
  feature set–which is a weird statement to come from a developer.
</p>
<p>
  This is an argument for craftsmen teams.  Craftsmen have many tools in their bag, and 
  UX is one of them.  Part of being a craftsman is to know enough about UX that you can 
  talk to an expert as well as do some UX.  Just like a UX expert craftsman can dabble in 
  code.  A craftsmen has many shallow skills as well as a few very deep skills.  Craftsmen 
  teams have individuals with diverse expertise talents and a common knowledge of 
  intermediate and beginner talents.  It is very fun to be on these teams, when the work 
  is one which has quality–quality of being &ldquo;aesthetically&rdquo; impressive as well 
  as &ldquo;feature set&rdquo; impressive.
