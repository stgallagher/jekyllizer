<h3>How old were you when you started programming.</h3>
<p>
	I was around 12
</p>
<h3>How did you get started programming.</h3>
<p>
	Whenever I would visit my grandmother growing up, one of the highlights was she had space 
	invaders on her computer. Once, my Uncle Don saw me captivated by space invaders and decided 
	to show me how computer games/application are written. He pulled up a command prompt in DOS 
	and started writing QBasic code to create a simple application. I was amazed that it was so 
	easy to talk to a computer. I wanted to do it myself.
</p>
<h3>What was your first language?</h3>
<p>
	BASIC
</p>	
<h3>What languages have you used since you started programming?</h3>
<p>
	Java, C++, C#, SAS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Ruby, C, Basic, Python, Assembly Language, Visual 
	Basic, SQL, ASP
</p>
<h3>What was the first real program you wrote?</h3>
<p>
	In school I wrote a Jabber client in C#. I was impressed by the drag and drop rich client tools 
	in Visual Studio. That lasted about a day.
</p>
<h3>What was your first professional programming gig?</h3>
<p>
	Working for a client project with Object Mentor. The first team I was on included Micah Martin, 
	David Chelimsky, Tim Ottinger, Dave Astels, Craig Demyonovich, James Grenning, and Dean Wampler. 
	I had more than just a few mentors to learn from. It was an awing experience for me seeing how great 
	coders code.

<h3>
	If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?
</h3>
<p>
	Play well with others. It takes teams working well together to create most meaningful software.
</p>	
<h3>What’s the most fun you’ve ever had programming?</h3>
<p>
	Working with the 8th Light team on a project. Many times seeing the requirements for a story, I will 
	say to myself, “can that even be done”? After seeing creative solutions from the team, it has taught 
	me if you are working with good people and good tools, there are only endless solutions. The most 
	amusing thing to learn about programming is if something isn’t all ready there, invent it.
