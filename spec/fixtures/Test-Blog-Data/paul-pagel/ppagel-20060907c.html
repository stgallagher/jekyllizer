	Prefactoring is when you see a piece of code which the story you are working on 
	which has a refactorings which would make your story easier. I have seen prefactoring 
	to be a dangerous process. On one hand, you save time when you know that this 
	refactorings will need to be done. You are faced with the choice of writing temporary 
	code (in the sense of duplicate then refactor) or refactoring, then writing quality code. 
	The software designer in me always wants to choose the prefactoring solution, since it 
	gets to make code cleaner, remove duplication, and be more efficient. Then I can stand 
	on the mountain top waving my flag. 
</p>
<p>
	There are a few problems right off the bat. First, the uber-developer in all of us will 
	refactor as much as we can, therefore refactor based scope creep is bound to show up. I 
	don’t really know how to stay away from scope creep in this manner. 
</p>
<p>
	Prefactoring can lead to a version of design up front which is detrimental if you don’t 
	need it. However, sometimes you know up front this design simplification will cut the story 
	time in half. Do you prefactor? What kinds of smells make it ok or terrible to prefactor? 
</p>
<p>
	I have tried backing my way in and using test(s) as a life jacket, so once the test passes, 
	the refactoring is done. However, the problem with this is it leaves me with half done 
	refactorings. The code is constantly moving up in quality, however, it might not look it due 
	to the inconsistencies produced by half done refactorings. I generally think of a complete 
	refactorings as something that made my system better in some manner I would like developers 
	who are extending the behavior of the system to use the refactorings as a model.
</p>
<p>
	Do my refactorings make the system easier to extend? Half-factorings don’t, but they do 
	provide a manageable slope moving positive. I don’t have the time to tackle the big 
	refactorings, but I don’t want to leave them unfinished.
