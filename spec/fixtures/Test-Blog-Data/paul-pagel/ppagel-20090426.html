<h1>Bug free or Free Bugs</h1>

  I will not charge a client for a bug fix.  Not a penny.  If I make a mistake, it is 
  my professional obligation to fix it.

  If something doesn’t work with my car, there could be catastrophic consequences, I 
  would be mad unless the company has a solution and offers to fix it for free.  As a 
  car owner, I expect nothing less.  If a doctor makes a mistake, the patient has the 
  right to sue the doctor for malpractice.  Why is it if I make a mistake, I get off 
  scot free?  Or worse, I get paid to fix my own mistakes.

  I know sometimes the devil is in the details.  What is a bug?  This is not an easy 
  question to answer, but if there are customer written acceptance tests for the system, 
  the items that fall through are fewer.  These are general rules I go by when deciding 
  if something is a bug or not.
</p>
<p>
  One: I made a mistake.  These are usually easy to notice, due to the redness in my 
  face when the bug is reported.  It is clear to me, I made a mistake, and it is clear 
  I need to fix the bug.  It should not cost the customer any money and the process should 
  be transparent.
</p>
<p>
  Two: There is a mistake that both development and the customer team should have caught.  
  A scenario the customer should have specified and during development I should have 
  noticed and brought to their attention.  The fault goes on both parties and can be fixed 
  at some version of half price (i.e. every other or a half price story).
</p>
<p>
  Three: The application doesn’t behave correctly due to a missed specification.  a 
  scenario that the customer missed or a piece of the business logic that wasn’t fully 
  correct.  Almost everyone makes some mistakes.  This is not a bug to me, but a feature 
  enhancement.  It can be written up as a story and completed.
</p>
<p>
  I think it is important to build faith with the customer that there is a team of developers 
  that are accountable.  When you create the culture of accountability, it spreads.  The 
  customer team is willing to be accountable when they make a mistake.  When no one is afraid 
  to make or admit to a mistake, the projects quality is positively affected.  Finally, by 
  taking financial ownership of a bug, I build a trust with my stakeholders of the project.
