  My path in becoming a craftsman was not through conventional academics.  I did get a 
  Bachelor degree in Computer Science.  During those years of learning, I was taught a 
  lot about how to learn and how to communicate, but I learned nothing about how to 
  practice my craft of software.  I learned how 
  <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> 
  works, how registers are able to do math .  All of this is interesting and some of 
  it is useful for a broader view of computer interactions as a whole.  None, however, 
  taught me about developing software as a craft.  I did some programming, which is 
  a prerequisite for any kind of software development.

  My real learning began after school.  Learning software as a craft was not done in 
  books.  It took being around journeymen and master craftsmen to learn the way they 
  think.  Observing their idiosyncrasies and approach to a problem is part of the 
  learning.  Much of the wisdom is tacit.  For me it is watching the way my mentor 
  approaches a story.  The way a craftsman sees a problem and digests it, without 
  hurry, and finds a satisfactory solution.  Then they write code, introducing faults 
  and fallacies the original solution could not have predicted. Finally, a meticulous 
  approach to improve each fault in the code.  The whole time demanding perfection, 
  without ever hitting it.  This is the good code I strive to write.  I can’t learn 
  that by looking at the solution though.

  These are observations of behavior and intent, not of actions.  For example, I have 
  read about Test Driven Development, and it has made my job easier.  For awhile after 
  I learned it, I wrote a lot of simple assertions, almost reverse engineering my 
  production code in my head to figure out what the test code would look like.  However, 
  the practice itself became ten times more valuable when I saw my mentor use the tests 
  to design their API.  They would say things like &ldquo;what do I want this to do&rdquo; 
  or &ldquo;that doesn’t feel right, lets rename the method to this&rdquo;.  Those 
  insights into the thought process provide me with the experiential learning it takes 
  to further improve my craft.  When I started thinking about 
  <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> in a similar manner, it allows me to 
  clean up my code and know it still works, refactor my code into easily extendable 
  solutions, and it gives me the confidence to experiment with the aesthetics of my 
  code.  I couldn’t fully learn that from books alone.
</p>
<p>
  This is why it is so important to apprentice as a software developer.  There are many 
  things about development that I only learned through watching the behaviors and actions 
  of the craftsmen I admire.  To me, these are the things that open up the software world 
  to gain wisdom.  For example, to be a better developer is not to learn a new language, 
  but to have the wisdom to learn and understand any computer language, which requires 
  you to learn new languages all the time.
