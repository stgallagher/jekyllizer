<h2>
  I would like to prelude this with an assurance that this is not the history of the 
  software craftsmanship.  I know a little of that history, as far back as Pete McBreen's 
  book Software Craftsmanship: the new imperative and Uncle Bob's Software Craftsmanship 
  articles.  No, this is just a brief history of the document hosted 
  <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org">here</a>.
</h2>
<p>
  It started when Uncle Bob's keynote speech last year at &ldquo;Agile 2008.&rdquo;  
  Uncle Bob proposed an amendment to the Agile Manifesto of &ldquo;Software Craftsmanship 
  over Crap.&rdquo;  Now, the manifesto, to my knowledge, was never changed.  However, 
  the software craftsmanship community started to become more active.  
</p>
<p>
  The actual manifesto started with a summit on Software Craftsmanship in Chicago, on 
  December 13, 2008.  There we discussed what it means to be a craftsman and an apprentice 
  and so forth.  We spent the afternoon discussing who the document would be written for, 
  what the contents of it would be, if the document already existed, and if it needed to 
  exist at all.  The attendees deserve a lot of credit on getting these ideas started, 
  and they are listed below.
</p>
<p>
  On a whiteboard, we wrote the first version of the manifesto and all the attendees signed 
  it.  For a few months afterwards, we talked about it on the google group, discussing the 
  various ideas put forth at the summit.  Then, in February, Doug Bradbury wrote an email 
  called &ldquo;The new Left Side&rdquo; which started to get the values and wording which 
  was refined into the actual Software Craftsmanship Manifesto.  There was a debate about 
  how the agile manifesto and the software craftsmanship manifesto that was instrumental in 
  moving forward with the manifesto.  You can read these threads at 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/software_craftsmanship">the software craftsmanship google group</a>.  
  They start with &ldquo;The new left side&rdquo; by Doug Bradbury and &ldquo;Right side, 
  revisited&rdquo; by Scott Pfister.  It was a fascinating conversation, which spawned the 
  final language of the manifesto.
</p>
<p>
  So, the question that was asked on the software craftsmanship mailing list and in the 
  twitterverse, is &ldquo;Why a software craftsmanship manifesto?&rdquo;  Well, if you will 
  permit me to give an existential answer, it is because the list has 1771 signatories as 
  of this writing.  That many people now know each other as craftsmen in some context.  
  They know they can talk as craftsmen, and hopefully move forward in our industry as 
  craftsmen.
</p>
<p>
  Let me use some other answers to the question to give another perspective.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;As of today, there are over 1500 signatures on the Manifesto.  1500 people are 
  fighting against &ldquo;crap code&rdquo;.  Those who have been fighting &ldquo;crap code&rdquo; 
  now know that they are not alone in their fight.  Those who write &ldquo;crap code&rdquo; 
  now know that there are 1500 people fighting against them.&rdquo; -- Micah Martin

<p>
  &ldquo;By becoming a vocal community, publishing a manifesto, beginning work on 
  establishing principles and concrete schools of thought, we are creating a light that 
  new developers can see. Those who are really interested can more easily find us, talk 
  to us about apprenticeships, meet companies that actively engage in craftsmanship 
  activities (apprenticeships, journeymen programs, etc.). In some cases, this will 
  introduce them sooner to these ideas, hopefully saving some from the frustrations they 
  can face in a different situation.&rdquo; -- Corey Haines
