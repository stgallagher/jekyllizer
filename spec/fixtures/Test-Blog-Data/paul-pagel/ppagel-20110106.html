<h1>Post-Agile: Standing on the shoulders of giants</h1>

  This February 13th will mark the decade anniversary of the creation and signing of the 
  original Agile Manifesto. At times I like to imagine that Snowbird event as the 
  software-world equivalent of the infamous story in which a group of politicians in a 
  cigar-filled backroom in Ohio decided that Warren G. Harding was about to become 
  America’s next president. The lean development thought leaders who came together that 
  weekend ten years ago similarly pushed forward their entire industry by uniting behind 
  a common set of beliefs.

  Over the last few years there have been countless books and conferences designed to 
  help flesh out the original Agile Manifesto statements. The Manifesto became a symbol 
  for developers whose voices were not being heard in the process of developing software 
  products. Now, a decade later, it is a commonly held belief that following Agile 
  development is the preferred way of building a software system. This was not always the 
  case, and I am appreciative of this renegade history as well as those initial 
  forward-thinking giants at Snowbird.

  A few years ago James Shore wrote a great blog post entitled The Decline and Fall of 
  Agile, in which he brought up ideas of technical debt and code quality that were lacking 
  in Agile development. He points out that the Agile practices have left us an approach to 
  writing code without necessarily specifying a method or process of writing that code. If 
  this is the case, let us pick up another model or metaphor of transformation and allow 
  our reactions to Agile development evolve the way postmodern artists pushed aside, 
  reacted to, and grew out of the failures, experiments, and limitations of modern art. Let 
  us also discuss what Agile is missing, put it under the microscope, and try to get our 
  brightest and most enthusiastic minds solving its problems. Let us call Agile 
  &ldquo;dead&rdquo; as the dramatic impetus to intelligently investigate those issues 
  with a mind towards exploration. The Agile Manifesto’s place in transforming our industry 
  is unquestionable, but it has taken us as far as it can. As David Berman writes, &ldquo;the 
  dead do not improve.&rdquo; Agile is filled with revolutionary ideas, but the revolution is 
  over.

  My post-Agile world is software craftsmanship. Not coincidentally it is a movement led by 
  some of the same members who attended the original Agile meeting a decade ago. If Agile 
  software taught us how to build products through its values, software craftsmanship’s 
  values are teaching me how to write great code.
</p>
<p>
  At the Software Craftsmanship Summit in 2008, Brian Marick proposed that one of the values 
  of software craftsmanship is to &ldquo;treat code as an end, not just a means.&rdquo; This 
  Kantian phrase has resonated in my mind a million times since then as an apt mantra for 
  software craftsmanship.

<p>
  Write great code and everything else becomes easier. It is easier to set expectations with 
  the customers or product owners when you are not dreading the mess of code that you have 
  to wade through. It is easier to train developers when the code base is filled with code 
  you want emulated. It is easier to plan a business around the code base if it is malleable 
  and tested.
</p>
<p>
  I’d like to suggest that we study the various cracks and strains of Agile not simply to 
  hypothesize ways in which Agile might be fixed, but instead to allow those imperfections 
  to present us with our next big challenge: the pursuit of great code. This is software 
  craftsmanship for me. Let the quest to define and reproduce quality endure. The King is 
  Dead. Long Live the King.
