<h1>Clojure Libs and Namespaces: require, use, import, and ns</h1>

<h2>
  Whenever I'm showing a newcomer to Clojure how to bring in code from other namespaces,
  I inevitably find myself apologizing that it's a bit complex and at times confusing. 
</h2>
<p>
  Now, I won't spend time moaning about the current state of namespaces (see 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/46559fd9eb127bdd">
    this Clojure mailing list discussion
  </a>
  and 
  <a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Loading,+Compiling,+and+Namespaces">
    the design discussion around namespaces in the Clojure Confluence
  </a>), but I thought it might be helpful to give an overview of the various calls you
  can make to require a Clojure lib.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start a Clojure REPL, where we'll outline the baseline commands to pull in libs.
  If you don't know how, <a href="http://clojure.org/downloads">download Clojure</a> and use
  <a href="http://clojure.org/getting_started">these instructions</a> to get a REPL up and
  running. If you already have the jar, just fire up a REPL using 
  <code>java -jar clojure-1.2.0.jar</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Later, we'll see the <code>ns</code> macro, which is much more idiomatic, and that's what
  you'll use in real Clojure projects. However, since <code>require</code>, <code>use</code>,
  and <code>import</code> are what you'll often use in the REPL, and because those are used
  behind the scenes, we'll start there.
</p>
<h3>The baseline: <code>require</code></h3>
<p>
  Let's say we want to use some of Clojure's built-in string operations. In the current 
  version of Clojure (1.2), there's a library called <code>clojure.string</code> which
  contains some useful functions like <code>split</code>, <code>join</code>, and 
  <code>capitalize</code>.
</p>
<p>Let's try to use <code>split</code> to break up the first line of a CSV file:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-1.clj"></script>
<p>
  Whoops! We forgot to actually tell Clojure that we're going to be using that namespace.
  There are a few namespaces (<code>clojure.core</code>, <code>clojure.set</code>, etc.) 
  that get auto-required into the <code>user</code> namespace when the <abbr>REPL</abbr> starts up,
  but <code>clojure.string</code> isn't one of them. So let's tell the <abbr>REPL</abbr> that we're
  going to be using <code>clojure.string</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-2.clj"></script>
<p>
  Great, so that worked. Let's take a moment to examine this, the most basic syntax for
  pulling in other Clojure code. <code>require</code> is just a Clojure function that
  takes a few different types of arguments.
</p>
<p>
  First, we could pass a single quoted symbol, and <code>require</code> will make the
  namespace named by that symbol available with the full <code>namespace/var-name</code>
  syntax in later code. We can also pass multiple quoted symbols, as below:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-3.clj"></script>
<p>
  Keep in mind that I'm starting a fresh REPL for each of these examples, to
  demonstrate what happens the first time you load a lib. In general, if you require a lib 
  a second time, nothing will happen.
</p>
<p> 
  There's a way around that (mainly for interactive development), as we'll see later on,
  but for now, just start up a new <abbr>REPL</abbr> as you're trying these out.
</p>
<p>
  It's worth noting here that the name of the lib itself parallels the directory structure,
  so in order to require <code>clojure.string</code>, you'd need a directory named 
  <code>clojure</code> relative to your classpath, and a file called <code>string.clj</code> 
  within that directory.
</p>
<p>
  That particular case is already true within the clojure jar, but it's something to keep
  in mind as you write your own Clojure code and have need to require it outside of the
  namespace where it lives.
</p>
<p>
  There's also a way to alias namespaces when you require them, such that you could
  refer to a <code>string</code> namespace rather than a <code>clojure.string</code>
  namespace, and you'd get the same result:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-4.clj"></script>
<p>
  The strange-looking quoted vector is a shorthand to avoid having to quote every
  individual symbol within the vector. You could type:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-5.clj"></script>
<p>
  The same concepts apply to using requiring multiple namespaces: <code>require</code>
  will take an arbitrary number of &ldquo;libspecs&rdquo;, such as the quoted symbol 
  and vector we've just seen. You can also mix and match symbols with vectors here:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-6.clj"></script>
<p>
  One last way to use <code>require</code> simplifies things when a prefix is the
  same in several libraries you want to load:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-7.clj"></script>
<p>
  Here, <code>clojure</code> is the prefix for both of the libraries we want, so
  we only need to type &ldquo;clojure&rdquo; once. <code>string</code> and 
  <code>test</code> are just libspecs in these situations, so you can use the
  <code>:as</code> option here as well:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-8.clj"></script>
<p>
  At this point, the variation between list and vector notation (parentheses and
  square brackets, respectively) may be driving you a bit bonkers.
</p>
<p>
  Never fear, the main thing to remember here is that a libspec should be either
  a quoted symbol or vector. So whenever you want to use something like <code>:as</code>,
  that thing (the libspec) should be a vector.
</p>
<p>
  It's become somewhat idiomatic to use lists for many other places we'll see later,
  but often that isn't actually enforced by the language, and there are in fact 
  situations where either vectors or lists might make more sense than the other
  from a semantic perspective.
</p>
<p>
  Phil Hagelberg has 
  <a href="http://p.hagelb.org/import-indent.html">some thought-provoking advice on this matter</a>.
  Just stick with the syntax you see here and in the Clojure documentation, remembering
  that you <em>must</em> use vectors for libspecs, and you'll be fine.
</p>
<p>
  If you're interested, you can see more details about what happens under the covers
  by appending a <code>:verbose</code> flag to the end of the argument list to 
  <code>require</code> (note that the <code>:verbose</code> flag is <i>outside</i>
  the libspec vector that pulls in <code>clojure.string</code>):
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054713.js?file=cjones-20101205-9.clj"></script>
<p>
  As you can see, <code>clojure.core/load</code> does the low-level loading, then we
  switch back to the <code>user</code> namespace (loading <code>clojure.string</code>
  made it the current namespace for a brief, shining moment), and finally we create
  an alias in the <code>user</code> namespace so that we can refer to 
  <code>clojure.string</code> as simply <code>string</code>. 
</p>
<p> 
  You'll see significantly more complex output from this if you do something similar
  with <code>clojure.test</code>, as it requires other libraries itself:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-11.clj"></script>
<p>
  That might have seemed intimidating at the start of the article, but you're likely
  now at a point now where you can guess the things that are being required under
  the covers.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I promised an example of reloading code from a particular namespace for
  interactive development, so here's how it works:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-12.clj"></script>
<p>
  Nothing happens the second time, as you can see. However, we can change that
  with the <code>:reload</code> flag:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-13.clj"></script>
<p>
  As you'd expect, the code gets loaded again with the <code>:reload</code> flag.
  The <code>reload-all</code> flag works similarly, but it will also make sure that
  all dependencies of the namespace in question are also reloaded.
</p>
<p>
  Now don't get overwhelmed yet. This is a lot of information for one function,
  but <code>require</code> is quite similar to other code-including functions
  and macros, so you'll see the same patterns again.
</p>
<h3>Using other namespaces' code as though it's yours: <code>use</code></h3>
<p>
  Sometimes, including any namespace information at all seems too verbose 
  (unit tests for a namespace are a good example). In these cases, we want
  to refer to vars as though they were ours, and that's where 
  <code>use</code> comes in. 
</p>
<p>  
  <code>use</code> actually uses two other functions to do the bulk of its work:
  <code>require</code> and <code>refer</code>. We've covered <code>require</code>
  already, and you'll rarely have a need to use <code>refer</code> directly, 
  so let's stick to the syntax of <code>use</code>.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-14.clj"></script>
<p>
  This is pretty heavy-handed. We've just blown away the definitions of 
  <code>replace</code> and <code>reverse</code> in <code>clojure.core</code>,
  so if we wanted to use those again, we'd have to fully qualify those 
  functions (something like <code>clojure.core/replace</code>. 
</p>
<p>
  In addition, this kind of wholesale inclusion of vars into our current 
  namespace can make it difficult do decipher where the definitions live.
  It's not something we want to do very often&mdash;=;maybe in the case of a unit test.
  It would be much better to limit the vars being referred to a named subset, like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-15.clj"></script>
<p>
  It still works, but now we're very clear about what we want. Anyone peeking into 
  this code for the first time will know immediately that <code>split</code> comes 
  from the <code>clojure.string</code> namespace, with no need to grep the whole
  project for the function definition. 
</p>
<p>  
  Note that the libspecs here are strikingly similar to what we used for 
  <code>require</code>! We have a new option, <code>:only</code>, where we used 
  <code>:as</code> before, and that option is associated with a list rather than a
  symbol, but it's easy to see that they're really the same sort of data structure.
</p>
<p>
  There are other options with <code>use</code> as well:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-16.clj"></script>
<p>
  This eliminates one of the problems with the first <code>use</code> example 
  (shadowing the <code>clojure.core</code> functions), but it's still not obvious
  at a glance where <code>split</code> comes from. I prefer <code>:only</code>
  in most situations. 
</p>
<p> 
  I've seen a quote come across my Twitter stream, attributed to Stuart Halloway
  (<a href="http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/Fortran/comp.lang.fortran/2004-05/0971.html">also discussed in the context of Fortran</a>),
  that recommends: &ldquo;Only use <code>use</code> with :only.&rdquo; With rare exceptions,
  I think that advice is pretty sound.
</p>
<p>
  There's one more available option, <code>:rename</code>, that lets us specify a map
  of vars to rename in the context of the current namespace:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-17.clj"></script>
<p>
  The most common of these options in the wild is certainly <code>:only</code>,
  but knowing that all of these are available will prepare you for that moment 
  when they're <em>exactly</em> what you need.
</p> 
<p>
  It's also worth pointing out here that you can also use <code>:as</code>,
  in the same way that we did with <code>require</code>, to provide a shorter
  alias for a namespace:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-18.clj"></script>
<p>
  So it turns out that we could use <code>use</code> for exactly the same 
  purposes as <code>require</code>, if we supply an empty list to the <code>:only</code>
  option. I don't recommend that use, as <code>require</code> itself is more idiomatic,
  but it's there!
</p>
<h3>Working with Java and deftypes/defrecords: <code>import</code></h3>
<p>
  In terms of syntax, <code>import</code> is much simpler than either <code>require</code>
  or <code>use</code>&mdash; there are no options to specify various behaviors.
</p> 
<p>
  In general, you can think of <code>import</code> as the way you get ahold of
  Java code. The specifics are only a bit more complex. Let's take a look.
</p>
<p>
  As long as the Java class you want it on the classpath, you can already
  refer to it using the fully-qualified name:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054725.js?file=cjones-20101205-19.clj"></script>
<p>
  If you're at all familiar with Java already, you already know that <code>import</code>
  can be used in a way similar to <code>use</code>, so that you can just talk about a
  <code>Date</code> in your code, rather than specifying the packages every time as
  <code>java.util.Date</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-21.clj"></script>
<p>
  You're probably already wondering if you can use a libspec instead of a plain
  old symbol! It's actually not a libspec in this case, but you can indeed get
  some different behavior here by using a quoted list, similarly to the shared-prefix
  example for <code>require</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-22.clj"></script>
<p>
  So here we're specifying a package as the first element of the vector, and the
  classes from that package that we want to import as the remaining elements. 
</p>
<p>
  You actually don't need a vector here (a list would do just fine), but it seems 
  more symmetrical to the other functions to use a vector, so that's what I prefer here.
  I haven't seen a strong trend emerge here, but particular projects generally stick
  to one or the other.
</p>
<p>
  It's very important to note here that <code>import</code> actually applies to <em>any</em>
  classes you need to get ahold of, including Clojure defrecords and deftypes. Pretend 
  you have a namespace <code>stuff</code> which contains a defrecord called 
  <code>BigWidget</code>.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-23.clj"></script>
<p>
  One important detail here is that the initial <code>require</code> is necessary&mdash;without
  it, you'll get a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. Defypes work identically, though their
  printed representation will of course vary. You can use the same vector notation as with Java
  classes, but here you'd specify a namespace rather than a Java package as the first element
  of the vector.
</p>
<p>
  This difference in code-loading requirements between deftypes/defrecords and other Clojure code
  may be surprising at first (it was to me, anyway), but the capitalization (along with several 
  semantic differences) is a good hint that something different needs to happen.
</p>
<p>
  And once you've <code>require</code>d the Clojure namespace, you can refer to defrecords and 
  deftypes by their fully-qualified names (e.g. <code>stuff.BigWidget</code>), in a similar way
  that you could with Java classes.
</p>
<h3>Bringing it all together: <code>ns</code></h3>
<p>
  While <code>require</code>, <code>use</code>, and <code>import</code> are the basis for all
  of your expeditions into other people's code in Clojure, you won't often be using them 
  directly in your actual Clojure projects. 
</p>
<p>
  It's far more idiomatic to use the <code>ns</code> macro, which pulls all of these together.
  The most basic use of <code>ns</code> gives just the namespace for the code that comes 
  afterwards&mdash;you'll see at least this much in just about every Clojure file you come across:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-24.sh"></script>
<p>
  Because we have so much background already, let's jump right into a much more complex 
  <code>ns</code> example:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-25.clj"></script>
<p>
  There's a lot here to look at, but take heart! Our trusty old <code>use</code> has been
  reincarnated as <code>:use</code>, the first element of a list within the <code>ns</code>
  macro body. 
</p>
<p>  
  The same goes for <code>require</code> -&gt; <code>:require</code> and <code>import</code>
  &ndash;&gt; <code>:import</code>. The other syntax change to get used to is that we no longer
  need to quote any of our libspecs&mdash;that's done internally. If you know much about how writing
  Clojure macros works, it'll make a good bit of sense.
</p>
<p>
  You can take any of our previous examples and plug them into the <code>ns</code> macro with
  only these small changes. Multiple <code>:use</code>, <code>:require</code>, or 
  <code>:import</code> forms are OK here:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-26.clj"></script>
<p>
  But it's more often the case that you'd eliminate the duplication there by rolling those into
  the same <code>:require</code> form:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054737.js?file=cjones-20101205-27.clj"></script>
<p>
  Another point of style: unless you're using the prefix form (as in <code>(clojure template walk)</code>
  from the first <code>ns</code> example above, you generally want to stick to one namespace per
  line, and left-align the libspecs.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've made these small syntax leaps, you've got all the knowledge you'll need to use 
  Clojure libs. Remember that you should prefer <code>ns</code> in any non-REPL code that you
  write&mdash;the basic <code>require</code>, <code>use</code>, and <code>import</code> are 
  just the building blocks.
</p>
<p>
  Libs can be among the most confusing areas of Clojure, but with a little effort and practice,
  they start to make a lot more sense. I hope this has been helpful&mdash;happy requiring!
</p>
