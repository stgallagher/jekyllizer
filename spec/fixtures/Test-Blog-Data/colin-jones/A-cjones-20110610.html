    Imagine this scenario: your User model <code>validates_uniqueness_of :email</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you use <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code> in Rails? Do you feel confident that 
    it works to prevent duplicate records? If you're like most of us, you won't have 
    given it much thought, but since I'm asking, you're second-guessing yourself.
  </p>
</h2>
<p>
  And indeed you should. More and more, the Rails documentation and community blogs 
  reflect the problems with <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code> (see Further Reading 
  below), and the fact that you can't depend on it to prevent duplicates in your 
  database.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;You can't?!?&rdquo; Right. It's called <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code>, 
  and it <em>will</em> perform that validation... right up until your project hits 
  production.
</p>
<p>
  First, let's take a look at what happens normally. When saving an Active Record, your 
  validations run first. So by virtue of the <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code> call, 
  ActiveRecord will check the database to see if this User is the only one with that 
  email address. If so, great! Save away!

<p>
  Otherwise, the save fails, and errors are populated on the object to let you know 
  what went wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Everything looks good so far. Now what's the big deal about your app going to production? 
  Well, with any reasonably sized application, you'll need multiple application server 
  processes or at least threads (Mongrel, Passenger, Tomcat, etc.) to handle incoming 
  traffic. And that's when the problem strikes.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
  Now Impatient Ian creates an account, quadruple-clicking the &ldquo;Create Account&rdquo; 
  button after filling out his info. Let's say either there isn't any Javascripty 
  double-click protection on that button or he has Javascript turned off.
</p>
<p>
  Now somewhere in the intertubes, those four requests are all vying for your app servers' 
  attention, and two of them happen to hit the app servers simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
  Now, each process checks the database to see if the newly-constructed (but as yet unsave) 
  object is unique for the given scoping, as before. Now, both of them say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 
  and so both of them can go ahead and save. Hooray!
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054847.js?file=cjones-20100610-3.txt"></script>
<p>
  Wait. Not hooray - the opposite of that. Now we have duplicate records in our database, 
  after we explicitly said that we didn't want that to happen.
</p>
<p>
  So that's the problem - <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code> doesn't work as our intuitions 
  might lead us to expect. What's the solution? Well, if you need to make sure you've got no 
  duplicate records, you'll want a database-level constraint: a unique index.
</p>
<p>
  <code>has_one</code> has similar problems, though there are dozens of possible root causes 
  of those in application logic, so I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.
</p>
<h3>A Solution: <code>consistency_fail</code></h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/trptcolin/consistency_fail"><code>consistency_fail</code></a> 
  is a brand-new gem I wrote that aims to make it easier to fix these problems. By installing 
  the gem (<code>gem install consistency_fail</code> for Rails 3, or <code>gem install 
  consistency_fail -v=0.1.1</code> for Rails 2.3), you get an executable 
  (<code>consistency_fail</code>) that will print out a report of the indexes you're 
  missing.
</p>
<p>
  Here's an example. We've got two models in this Rails 3 project, both of which have missing 
  indexes:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054847.js?file=cjones-20100610-4.rb"></script>
<p>
  So, getting an exhaustive list of missing indexes is as easy as <code>consistency_fail</code>:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054847.js?file=cjones-20100610-5.txt"></script>
<p>
  The first column of the report, labeled "Model", shows you where the call to 
  <code>validates_uniqueness_of</code> or <code>has_one</code> issues from, and the 
  &ldquo;Table Columns&rdquo; column shows you the table with the <em>database</em> 
  columns that need a unique index. Multiple column names in parentheses mean that a 
  composite unique index is required.
</p>
<p>
  For performance reasons, you'll want to think carefully about how you order the columns 
  in a multicolumn unique index, but for our purposes, any ordering will work to enforce 
  uniqueness.
</p>
<p>
  It's worth noting here that by adding these indexes, we <em>will</em> protect our data, 
  but at the risk of bubbling a database-level uniqueness-violation exception to the top 
  level, and potentially showing our user an error page. Unless, that is, we want to 
  hack ActiveRecord up to catch the database-specific exception (done it!) and give a 
  nice explanation. So, buyer beware - for the time being, there's application-specific 
  code that will need to be written if handling these user-facing errors is a concern.
</p>
<p>
  I'd love to hear whether you find this reporting from <code>consistency_fail</code> to 
  be valuable, and what improvements you'd like to see.
