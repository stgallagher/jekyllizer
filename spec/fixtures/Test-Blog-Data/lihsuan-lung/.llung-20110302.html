<h1>Jenkins, RVM, and Selenium</h1>

  I have been working on migrating half a dozen 8th Light projects to our continuous integration
  server last week. Barring one <a href="https://github.com/dougbradbury/rubarb">open-source gem project</a>,
  most of them were Rails.
</h2> 
<p>
  I have used Jenkins to build, pipeline, and install projects on Windows with batch
  commands and ant tasks in the past, but this would be the first time I set up Rails projects and deal with Ruby
  management and running features in a headless environment.
</p>
<h3>RVM</h3>
<p>
  Obviously the center piece of this operation is <b>RVM</b>. The catch is that Jenkins does not load your bash
  profiles on slave environment for each build, which is usually how you load <b>RVM</b> into a shell session.
</p>
<p>
  This can be resolved with either including <b>RVM</b> scripts in Jenkins' startup, or run,  
  <code>source ~/.bash_profile</code> at the beginning of your build steps assuming you followed the post 
  install instruction in <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">RVM installation guide</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Afterward, you can execute <code>rvm use 1.9.2@gemset</code> to pick up project setting, or take advantage
  of .rvmrc&mdash;business as usual.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can install Jenkins' <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Rake+Plugin">Rake plugin</a>.
  The plugin allows you to choose a Ruby installation per project, and since version 1.7, with <b>RVM</b> integration
  you can also pick a specific gemset you created on <b>RVM</b>.
</p>
<p>
  From Jenkins' homepage, go to Manage Jenkins, Configure System, and fill out <b>RVM</b> installation path under
  the Rake section. Now at your project configuration, when you add a new build step to invoke Rake task, you will
  see a list of Ruby versions and available gemsets ready at your disposal. The Rake plugin refreshes this list
  every time you save the Configure System page.
</p>
<h3>Headless Selenium</h3>
<p>
  Some Rails projects are set up to run acceptance tests against a real browser, and unfortunately our continuous
  integration box is without a display. The common solution for this type of problem seems to be installing <b>Xvfb</b>,
  a virtual framebuffer server that renders your <b>GUI</b> tools in memory:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/812630.js?file=xvfb.sh"></script>
<p>
  Moving forward, you can write a script to run Xvfb whenever you kick start a build, and make sure the <b>DISPLAY</b>
  variable is set accordingly when Selenium is up. Your other option is to install the 
  <a href="https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless">headless gem</a>, and call to launch the server with Ruby <b>API</b>
  in your <code>features/support/env.rb</code> file:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/812632.js?file=headless.rb"></script>
<p>
  Now armed with <b>RVM</b> and headless gem, you can create a new job on Jenkins with relative ease. I hope,
  at this point, you will have a reasonably good grasp on how to set up your own Rails project on a <b>CI</b> server,
  and ready to reap the profits of the continuous integration process.
</p>
<p>
  To sum it up, here is the final recipe for a Rails project's build step:
