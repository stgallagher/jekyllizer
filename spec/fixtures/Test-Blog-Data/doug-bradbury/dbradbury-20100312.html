  Our secret is out. A recently published photo revealed it hanging lazily in the corner of 
  our office: a hammock.
</p>
<p>
  Why would an office of software development professionals have a hammock in it?
</p>
<p>
  Well the short answer is that it's always been a dream of 8th Light co-founder Micah Martin 
  to have a hammock in the office. For me, it's an indispensable part of my daily rhythm.
</p>
<h3>The Reboot</h3>
<p>
  I remember when I started my first internship while in college just how hard it was to stay 
  alert for an 8 hour day. I was reminded of this this summer when I watched the head of one 
  of our interns start to bob and shake at around 2:00 every afternoon. My solution early in 
  my career was caffeine. That sweet green bubbly nectar of the awake dropped out of the vending 
  machine into my hand each afternoon.
</p>
<p>
  I've since given up caffeine, and have learned to get adequate sleep. But there are still 
  some afternoons when everything catches up with me and I just stop making progress. Maybe 
  a particular problem just won't budge, or I have to read some dry documentation. Whatever 
  it is, my brain just shuts down. I sometimes describe it as a fog. It's like that feeling 
  just before getting a headache.
</p>
<p>
  Enter the hammock. Instead of just pushing through and making no progress for an hour or 
  more, I go lie down in the hammock. I lie there and focus on my breathing until I just 
  barely fall asleep. When that first dream sequence starts to roll, I get up, shake out the 
  weariness and start back to work more focused and more alert. I like to call it my personal 
  reboot. Like a sluggish Windows box, I'll I need is to shut all the way down and then turn
  back on again.
</p>
<p>
  I've heard a story about how Thomas Edison would do a similar thing to refocus himself when 
  he was working. He didn't have a hammock, but he would sit in a comfortable chair with a pile 
  of ball bearings in his hand. When he would reach that just barley asleep state, his hand 
  would drop, the bearings would fall and wake him back up.
</p>
<h3>Step Back, Go Around</h3>
<p>
  The hammock to me is also a reminder to slow down. As Bob Martin's popular mantra goes 
  &ldquo;The only way to go fast is to go well.&rdquo; It is also an aid in stepping back from 
  a problem to find that area of minimum resistance. Richard Sennett talks about this idea in 
  &ldquo;The Craftsman.&rdquo; He says that one of the qualities of a craftsmen is finding the 
  most forgiving approach to a problem. That skill requires stepping into and out of detail on 
  a problem. That is, focussing on the point of tension, but them zooming out to see if going 
  around might be better than going through. A little bit of time in the hammock is great for 
  that. Many times, I've gone to the hammock frustrated with a problem, only to emerge with a 
  completely tangential solution.
</p>
<h3>It's a Team Thing</h3>
<p>
  Here is what some of the other craftsmen at 8th Light have to say about the hammock.

  <em>Short cat naps help reset my brain to keep me thinking clearer throughout a long day.</em>

  <em>I often head there at around 3 (which is coffee time at the client office).  In addition 
  when I'm stuck on something I'll try and clear my head in the hammock, when juggling doesn't 
  work.</em>
  <br />
  -- Eric Smith

<p>
  <em>After a lunch that was a little too big.  A 10 minute hammock-nap gets me back on my feet.  
  In moments of coding frustration, a quick trip to the hammock helps me relax and clear my 
  mind.</em>
  <br />
  -- Micah Martin

  These guys echo my feelings about the hammock and affirm how giving ourselves the permission 
  to lie down in the middle of the day is beneficial not only to our own health, but also the 
  health or our projects.  It's one of our practices that helps to keep us delivering great code 
  day after day, week after week, month after month.
