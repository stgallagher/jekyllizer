  Hi, my name is Doug and I don’t own an iPhone and I don’t plan on buying one anytime soon.  
  Don’t get me wrong, I love the technology. It’s really cool, but the problem I have is the 
  message the medium itself communicates.  No media is entirely neutral.  Each medium we use 
  to communicate sends it’s own message independent of what we are actually trying to say.
</h2>
<p>
  The message of the iPhone is this: &ldquo;Be somewhere, anywhere, other than where you are right 
  now.&rdquo;  It says to you that something is going on somewhere in the world that is more 
  important, more interesting, or more entertaining than what is happening in front of you 
  right now.

  My wife and I enjoy theater quite a lot.  I’m amazed to watch couples sit before the curtain 
  rises each in their own virtual world, not talking to each other, not interacting.  What’s 
  worse is that the house lights go down, and all over the theater little faces glow in the iPhone 
  backlight as their owners send one last email or double check a score.
</p>
<p>
  The moments before the curtain goes up in a theater are agonizing and magical.  The minutes 
  tick by slowly as your excitement builds for the thing you are about to see.  You look around 
  at the little details all over the theater, siting in a seat where generations of theater-goers 
  have sat.  The lights go down and the overture starts and all of you senses are heightened by 
  the waiting.  With an iPhone in your hand, the lights go down and curse them because you didn’t 
  quite have time to finish the thing you were doing.

  I had a friend growing up whose dad was always full of clever expressions.  This one has always 
  stuck with me: &ldquo;Wherever you are, be there.&rdquo;  When I heard it as a kid, it didn’t make that 
  much sense.  How can I be someplace other than where I am?  It took a couple of decades and a 
  stylish visionary company to answer my question.  But here it is now.  The iPhone will let you 
  be anywhere but in the place that you are.

  The issue is one of presence.  It’s being in a place without actually being present there.

  I’ll admit it, I have a serious problem with games.  When I went away to college in 1998, I 
  gave away my copy of Warcraft II, because I knew there was no way I could do well in college 
  if I had access to it.  I sometimes barley say hello to my friend when I walk into his house, 
  grab his iPad and start playing Plants Vs. Zombies.  I missed half of Thanksgiving this year, 
  because I found my cousin’s phone lying about with Angry Birds on it.  I don’t own any of these 
  devices now because I want to protect my presence wherever I am.
</p>
<p>
  I know the change these devices are bringing is inevitable and ultimately I will have to learn 
  to live life alongside such devices.  But, for now I’ll hold off and try to keep myself present 
  in every moment of my life and in every line of code I write.  What have you missed today?
