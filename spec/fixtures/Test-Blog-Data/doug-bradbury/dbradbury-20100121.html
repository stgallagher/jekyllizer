<h1>Rolemodel Recap Day 2</h1>

<h2>
  My second day at role model found me pairing with 
  <a href="http://www.rolemodelsoft.com/people/tim_irwin">Tim Irwin</a> on another one 
  of Rolemodel's projects.  Tim described this project as being &ldquo;all about the 
  data.&rdquo;  It was my first chance to work on a Rails 3 project.  My normal client 
  work has kept me away from the Rails world for about a year and a half, so it was nice 
  to dive back in and see what had happened while I was away.  I learned a ton of stuff 
  from Tim as we worked together.  It's amazing to me how even after using Ruby for so 
  long and so much, it still has some wonderful surprises up it's sleeve for me.
</h2>
<h3>1) Rails 3 scopes</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://edgerails.info/articles/what-s-new-in-edge-rails/2010/02/23/the-skinny-on-scopes-formerly-named-scope/index.html">Scopes</a>
  had a previous life in Rails 2, but I saw how Tim had used them to clean up a number of 
  fairly complicated queries and made them accessible to consumers of the model.
</p>
<h3>2) OpenStruct</h3>
<p>
  It's one of those feature I've always wanted, and now that I think about it, it wouldn't 
  be that hard to build. It's a super easy way to create a "data only" object.. From the 
  ri for OpenStruct:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054054.js?file=dbradbury-20110121-1.rb"></script>
<p>
  It is a great class that helps bridge that data and code gap in ruby. We used it to 
  create a fake record that was the result of combining two other records. The resulting 
  combinations were temporary, didn't need to be stored in the database, and needed to be 
  more type-tolerant than the ActiveRecord model could be.
</p>
<h3>3) Anonymous Blocks</h3>
<p>
  At some point we were working with a collection, and I was writing something like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054054.js?file=dbradbury-20110121-2.rb"></script>
<p>
  I commented that since I'd been learning Clojure, this syntax just seem clunky to me now. 
  Tim came to the rescue with a syntax I had never seen in Ruby but it was exactly what I 
  wanted.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1054054.js?file=dbradbury-20110121-3.rb"></script>
<p>
  Who knew the ampersand could be so cool?  This syntax makes the parameter passed to the 
  block anonymous and just sends the method to that anonymous parameter.
</p>
<p>
  That evening we headed to the Research Triangle Park where luck would have it, two local 
  user groups were meeting.  Last week as I tweeted about my upcoming visit to the area and 
  the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/agileRTP/">Agile RTP</a> group invited me to come open 
  their meeting with a short talk.  I presented my 
  <a href="http://www.walkncode.com">Walk 'n Code</a> material and received an enthusiastic 
  reception from many of the Agile practitioners there.  
</p>
<p>
  After my talk and the groups networking time, I headed across the building to the 
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/">Raleigh.rb</a> meetup.  
  <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/ntalbott">Nathaniel Talbott</a> does a great job of 
  community building with this group.  This meetup featured 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/stuarthalloway">Stuart Halloway</a> giving an updated 
  version of his 
  <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/191-rubyconf2009-clojure-for-ruby-programmers">Clojure for Ruby Programmer</a> 
  talk.  Relevance was out in full force with many of the Clojure core team member coming 
  along to support (or egg on) Stu.
</p>
<p>
  So <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/craftsmen/colin_jones">Colin</a> recently did an 8LU 
  session on clojure, and I've spent some time working through 
  <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems in an effort to get familiar 
  with the language.  I have been having a lot fun with it. My brain has stretched in my 
  first real study of functional programming, but to be honest with you, I hadn't really 
  gotten it yet.   I really didn't understand why Colin and Micah are so excited about 
  Clojure.  Stuart though, really got my attention.  I'm on the bandwagon now!
</p>
<p>
  What did it for me was Stu's take on polymorphism.  He explained how object oriented 
  languages have these great concepts like polymorphism, but they are tied to other language 
  features like type.  Clojure presents concepts like these "al a carte."  Really, what does 
  the type of a thing have to do with a runtime decision about which function should be called 
  at a particular time?  Stu also blew the socks off of data encapsulation, showing how 
  everything in Clojure uses the same collections api for data, so the need to "hide" data 
  becomes almost absurd.  I felt as though my world was beginning to crumble, but for some 
  reason it made me really excited.  
</p>
<p>
  There is no doubt in my mind that Clojure is going to be big, but as Stuart said, nobody is 
  really in a hurry.  The Clojure team is focusing on doing it right, learning from the 
  feedback they are getting.  They aren't trying to take over the world by next week.
</p>
<p>
  I got to meet several of the local Rubyists after the presentation and observed an epic text 
  editor battle on the steps outside the meetup building.  Nathaniel Talbott dug his heels in 
  on TextMate and was being assaulted on all sides by passionate VIMers.  The basic debate came 
  down to uniformity and an editor that matched your expectations no mattter where you sat down 
  to use it (TextMate) vs. an editor that you can completely trick out to your personal tastes, 
  but renders anyone else sitting down at your computer helpless.  I stayed pretty quiet, but 
  for me, the top priority in an editor is it's ability to refactor.  Extracting a method or 
  variable and inlining are abstractions to me.  I don't want to have to think about how to do 
  them, I want an editor to do them for me.  So as for me and my house, we'll stick with the 
  JetBrains tools for now.
</p>
<p>
  It was a very full day, and I felt privileged to have interacted with so many wonderful people.
