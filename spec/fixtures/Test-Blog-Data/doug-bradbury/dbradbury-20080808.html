<h3>How old were you when you started programming.</h3>
<p>
	When I was about 11 or so I bought a Color Computer III at a garage sale. I started typing in 
	some basic programs that I found in a math text book or something. I had no disk or tape drive, 
	so I had to start over every time I turned the computer on. I don’t remember what the program did. 
	I do remember playing the game with the bouncing ball, paddle and busting up bricks.
</p>
<h3>How did you get started programming.</h3>
<p>
	I started writing static web pages somewhere around 1995. I was the president of my high 
	school’s computer club and we built the first every website for 
	<a href="http://www.morgan.k12.il.us/jvillehs/">Jacksonville High School</a>, complete with a 
	presentation to the school board. I’m pretty sure the site had blinking text.
</p>
<p>
	We also started learning C++ in the club. We didn’t have a text book, but our sponsor, Robin 
	Manker, would print out sheets each week for us and we’d bind them into one of those plastic 
	spiral bound things that you needed the machine to open up the binding.
</p>
<h3>What was your first language?</h3>
<p>
	BASIC
</p>
<h3>What was the first real program you wrote?</h3>
<p>
	Like others, I’m not sure what makes a program ‘real.’ I remember that my first C++ exercise 
	was a Fahrenheit to Celsius converted.
</p>
<h3>What languages have you used since you started programming?</h3>
<p>
	BASIC, ADI Sharc assembly and other uber-fun machine languages, C, C++, Java, Ruby
</p>
<h3>What was your first professional programming gig?</h3>
<p>
	My first job was writting DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithms in assembly. The first 
	thing I worked on was the compressor algorithm, I implemented time sharing on the averaging 
	algorithms and reduced the cycle count by 30% or so. The processor was an Analog Devces Sharc. 
	It had two data buses and two ALUs, so you could basically make two read/writes from memory 
	and two arithmetic calculations per clock cycle. We’d write lines of code that looks like 
	this:
</p>
<p>
	<code>r1 = r2+r5; r3=r6-r7; dm(i6) = r2; r5= pm(i3);</code>
</p>	
<p>
	Everyline of code would be followed by a line of comments explaining the line. It was 
	painstaking work, but It’s how I learned to be methodical and linear. It was also a whole 
	lot of fun to listen to your code after you finished it.
</p>
<h3>If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would 
	it be?</h3>
<p>
	I still remember one of the first things Robin, the first person to teach me how to code used 
	to say. I still pull it out often. It went something like this.
</p>

		There is a teapot sitting on the counter. How does the programmer solve the problem of making 
		tea? He picks up the teapot and sets it on the stove.

		There is a teapot sitting on the floor. How does the programmer solve the problem of making 
		tea? He picks up the the teapot and sets it on the counter. The he says “I’ve solved this 
		problem before”
	</li>
</ol>	
<h3>What’s the most fun you’ve ever had programming?</h3>
<p>
	Kevin Moore was one of my first mentors when I started working at Shure fresh out of college. These 
	was a time, when we would stay late every Tuesday night and code together. He was the first one to 
	tell me about XP things like “What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work” and pair 
	programming. Late on Tuesdays we didn’t have any managers telling us to stop wasting time with two 
	people at one computer. We paired together writing the microcontroller code for the 
	<a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/mixers-dsp/dfr22-audio-processor">DFR22</a>. 
	We had a lot of fun and pulled of a pretty amazing project in something like 8 months.
