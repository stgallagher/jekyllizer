<h1>Rolemodel Recap Day 1</h1>

<h2>
  I spent the last three days on a Journeyman trip to visit 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/kauerrolemodel">Ken Auer</a> and his team at 
  <a href="http://www.rolemodelsoft.com">Rolemodel Software</a> in Holly Springs, NC.  
  I first met Ken at 
  <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/"><span class="caps">SCNA</span></a> 
  and after hearing his heart for apprenticeship and living an integrated life I’ve 
  been looking for an opportunity to visit ever since.
</h2>
<p>
  I arrived late Sunday night and settled into the Rolemodel guest room (which doubles 
  as the Rolemodel break room).  Ken has build a new facility that has shortened his 
  commute to the 20 steps from the upper level where he lives with his family to the 
  lower level where the Rolemodel Software team does it’s work.
</p>
<p>
  After a short but sound sleep in the guest / break room, I joined Ken in the morning 
  pairing on one of his rails projects.  This particular application began life as a 
  <a href="http://spreecommerce.com">Spree</a> implementation, but has since gained 
  more and more custom code and functionality.  Ken explained to me the interesting 
  place that this project is in.  Ken referred to it is as a pivot point, which he 
  says is a lean startup term.  The entrepreneur launched with one business plan in 
  mind, but what people are using the most is only a small part of that orginal plan.  
  So the “pivot” is to refocus on the successful bit, listening to their feedback and 
  growing and expanding that part of the business.
</p>
<p>
  This project was suffering a little from growing pains.  Using Spree has made many 
  things difficult and the system is approaching the point of needing an overhaul.  Ken 
  reminded me of the importance of throwing away early prototypes and starting fresh, 
  armed with the knowledge gained from the experiment. It is often hard to do, but 
  eventually those early shortcuts taken to prove out an idea quickly catch up and halt 
  further progress.
</p>
<p>
  I joined Ken and his family upstairs for lunch where they shared with me the stories 
  the many &ldquo;prototypes&rdquo; that their lives have tried.  I heard about the 
  starting and stopping of Rolemodel Studios, a video production company that involved 
  the entire family.  I heard the baby grand piano in the living room played by Ken’s 
  daughter.  I saw the lego constructions of their youngest.  I was impressed with the 
  way that Ken and his wife have listened and observed their children’s interests and 
  talents and created an environment where they could run with those things in a safe 
  and fun journey of self discovery.  Ken’s middle child is currently apprenticed to 
  Rolemodel’s graphics designer, and I watched him being mentored in the afternoons on 
  the tools and practices of good design.
</p>
<p>
  In the afternoon I sat with 
  <a href="http://www.rolemodelsoft.com/people/paul_nicholson">Paul Nicholson</a> on a 
  mobile Javascript project.  The application was being built for a research group so in 
  many places it defied the normal patterns of usability in a typical application.  
  Everything being done was being done for a specific purpose and it was important for 
  things to work the way they did for the sake of the research.  It was great for me to 
  see someone using javascript to build a mobile application. Mobile is one of the next 
  domains I will be working in, and I’ve been trying to figure out if javascript or native 
  apps is the way to go.

<p>
  The Auer’s were very gracious by inviting me to share the evening with them.  A wonderful 
  meal, a cozy fire, and a family sing-a-long left me inspired.
