<h1>Meta-programming Comes Naturally to Intern</h1>

  We have a couple of interns in the office this summer.  They are kind of like Jr. Apprentices 
  - distinguished mostly by the fact that they are in school and will be returning to school 
  in the fall.  I've been working with Andrew this summer.  He just finished his Sophomore year 
  of High School and is just learning to program.  He's been working through a couple of ruby 
  tutorials:  Chris Pine's <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn to Program</a> in Ruby 
  and the ever-so-entertaining-especially-for-a-high-schooler 
  <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</a>.
</h2>
<p>
  He was working on the <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=09">Orange Tree</a> 
  example for Pine's tutorial.  He had the class written and want to write a command line 
  interface to it.  This was what he tried to do.

<p>
  "What are you trying to do Andrew?"
</p>
<p>
  "I want to get a command from the user and call that command on the tree object."
</p>
<p>
  Now I had expected that Andrew would write a big if-else chain comparing strings and calling 
  methods. In my mind that's what a beginning programmer should learn. I learned to program in C++ 
  and that's the way I had to do it! I wasn't even sure that we would even touch meta-programming 
  this summer.
</p>
<p>
  But I had a second thought. "Why not show him some Meta Programming now?" I don't want to be 
  responsible for destroying the future career of an aspiring programmer, but what the heck? How 
  much damage could it possibly do?
</p>
<p>
  So I explained to Andrew how methods in Ruby aren't really methods, they are messages and how 
  you can "send" a message to an object. We modified his program to do what he wanted.

<p>
  I'm not sure that he completely understood all that, but there it is. Ruby let Andrew do the 
  thing that he naturally wanted to do.
