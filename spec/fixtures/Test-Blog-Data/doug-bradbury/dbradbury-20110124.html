<h1>Rolemodel Recap Day 3</h1>

<h2>
  My third and final day began with another breakfast graciously provided by Ken's wife 
  and a walk around Ken's land.  The house and studio sit on about 3.5 acres which is part 
  of the 12 acres he originally purchased.  He took me on a walk along the trail that he 
  has cut along the perimeter of the land.  The lots have some fun and interesting features 
  of hills and streams and cascading waterfalls.  I could see why Ken loves the place so 
  much as he showed me where the bonfires, <abbr title="All Terrain Vehicle">ATV</abbr> 
  rides, and paintball games take place.

<p>
  I had just a couple of hours in the studio before I had to catch my flight and I 
  continued with Tim Irwin on the same thing we had worked on the day before.  We got 
  into the view side of the story and I got to see how they were building their views with 
  haml and sass. My verdict is still out on these two templating languages.  I can see the 
  benefits they add on top of html and css, but I also wonder if the benefits are worth 
  the added complexity of another syntax.

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>
  There are a couple of other tools I came across in my visit that I thought were worth 
  mentioning.
</p>
<p>
  The Rolemodel team uses the mac app 
  <a href="http://www.abyssoft.com/software/teleport/">Teleport</a> to aid in their 
  pairing.  Teleport lets a mac connect to and control the keyboard and mouse of another.  
  It uses the Mac accessibility interface to basically turn a laptop into a keyboard and 
  mouse for another Mac.  It was super-responsive over the LAN and makes a good 
  alternative over passing a keyboard back and forth.
</p>
<p>
  Many projects are also using <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> along with 
  <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> to create and manage their stylesheets.  
  Compass gives you things like variables, includes, and mixins to make using and reusing 
  styles easier.  It's not something I've used before, but I think it's worth looking into.
</p>
<p>
  Tim was using <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>.  
  It's a password repository, but web based and available on any platform or browser.
</p>
<h3>Other random observations</h3>
<p>
  When you visit another shop, it's hard not to make comparisons.  I definitely noticed 
  that we at 8th Light are really obsessed with testing.  Some could probably fault us for 
  wasting too much time testing something that is easy, but we do it anyway.  I believe that 
  it pays off for us too.  We produce value for our customers just as quickly as anyone else 
  and we have higher degrees of confidence because of that.  It's what allows us to guarantee 
  our work to our clients. 
</p>
<p>
  Being in Ken's shop really made me want to work with younger and younger apprentices. 
  Teenaged students are capable of writing software and who knows what great developers they 
  might become with such a great head-start?
</p>
<h3>Come, follow me.</h3>
<p>
  Ultimately, I came away with great respect for what Ken is doing.  He's building a company, 
  a family, and a church all at the same time.  At the heart of all three efforts is the name 
  of his company, Rolemodel.  He's teaching young people about software, life, and faith based 
  on one of the oldest and most effective methods of education:  apprenticeship.
