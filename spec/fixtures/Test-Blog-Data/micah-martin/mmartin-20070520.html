<h1>Ruby DSL Blocks</h1>

<p>
	There’s a common pattern I’ve seen for developing DSLs (Domain Specific Language) in Ruby. 
	It’s used in RSpec, the Statemachine Gem, and Unclebob’s Clean Code talk at RailsConf 2007. 
	I haven’t seen a name for this pattern so I’ll call it the <strong>DSL Block Pattern</strong>.
</p>
<h4>RSpec</h4>
<!-- 
describe "Bowling Game" do
    it "should score 0 on a gutter game" do
        game = Game.new
        20.times { game.roll(0) }
        game.score.should eql(0)
    end
end -->
<h4>Statemachine</h4>
<!-- 
sm = Statemachine.build do
    trans :locked, :coin, :unlocked
    trans :locked, :pass, :locked
    trans :unlocked, :pass, :locked
    trans :unlocked, :coin, :unlocked
end -->
<h4>Parser</h4>
<!-- 
parser = Args.expect do
    boolean "l"
    number "p"
    string "d"
end -->
<p>
	Here’s the problem. You’ve got to write code for specific domain such as writing specifications 
	(RSpec), defining a Statemachine, or defining command line arguments (Unclebob’s Clean Code talk). 
	These domains have a contained and well defined terminology set. Often the cleanest, most elegant 
	way to express this code is to create a DSL.
</p>
<p>
	Before diving into the example, let me say that I like coffee as much as the next guy. But I feel 
	lost when ever I go to a Starbucks. As you know, Starbucks has a it’s own language, DSL if you will, 
	for ordering coffee. What follows is a DSL Block for ordering Starbucks coffee.
</p>
<p>
	The general grammar for ordering coffee is: <i>Size, Adjective (optional), Type of Coffee</i>. 
	This is by no means comprehensive but it’s sufficient for the example. So if you wanted to order a 
	large coffee, for example, you would say, <i>Grande Coffee</i>. A small espresso: <i>Short Americano</i>. 
	An extra large mixture of regular and decaffeinated coffee with some half and half: 
	<i>Venti Breve Half Caff</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Given the task to code these coffee orders, I’d like to be able to code it like this:
</p>	
<!-- 
Starbucks.order do
    grande.coffee
    short.americano
    venti.breve.half_caff
end 
-->
<p>
	Ok that looks good, but as you look closely, you’ll start to wonder about those methods, 
	<code>grande</code>, <code>short</code>, and <code>venti</code> “Do they have to be defined on the 
	Kernel?” you may ask. Defining them on the Kernel is a scary prospect. And that may convince you to 
	clutter the syntax by passing an object into the block like this:
</p>
<!-- 
Starbucks.order do |order|
    order.grande.coffee
    order.short.americano
    order.venti.breve.half_caff
end 
-->
<p>
	This would allow you to define the <code>grande</code>, <code>short</code>, and <code>venti</code> 
	methods on the object passed into the block. Although you do need an object where <code>grande</code>, 
	<code>short</code>, and <code>venti</code> will be defined, you don’t need to add an argument to the 
	block. You’ll find code out there, such as Migrations, that uses this less optimal route. It’s not 
	necessary. The trick to get rid of the argument is below:
</p>
<!-- 
module Starbucks

  def self.order(&block)
    order = Order.new
    order.instance_eval(&block)
    return order.drinks
  end

  class Order

    attr_reader :drinks

    def initialize
      @drinks = []
    end

    def short
      @size = "small"
      return self
    end

    def grande
      @size = "large"
      return self
    end

    def venti
      @size = "extra large"
      return self
    end

    def coffee
      @drink = "coffee"
      build_drink
    end

    def half_caff
      @drink = "regular and decaffeinated coffee mixed together"
      build_drink
    end

    def americano
      @drink = "espresso"
      build_drink
    end

    def breve
      @adjective = "with half and half"
      return self
    end

    private

    def build_drink
      drink = "#{@size} cup of #{@drink}"
      drink << " #{@adjective}" if @adjective
      @drinks << drink

      @size = @drink = @adjective = nil
    end
  end

end 
-->
<p>
	You can see that the Order object is doing all the work. It’s got the responsibility of interpreting 
	the DSL, so let’s call it the Interpreter Object. The <code>Module::order</code> method simply 
	creates an instance of <code>Order</code> and calls <code>istance_eval</code> on it. This causes the 
	block to execute using the binding of the <code>Order</code> instance. All of the methods on 
	<code>Order</code> will be accessible to the block.
</p>
<p>
	The Interpreter Object can do any number of things as it interprets the DSL. In this case it simply 
	generates a translation for Starbucks newbies. But, the sky’s the limit really.
