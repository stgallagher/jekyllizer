<p>
  Today we 
  <a href="http://limelight.8thlight.com/main/download">released a new and exciting 
  version of Limelight</a>. Just a reminder, Limelight is a user-interface framework 
  for Ruby. Included in this release are not only some new features, but also a new 
  means of production(application) distribution called Playbills, and a snazzy 
  production that documents the Limelight framework.
</p>


<h3>Playbills</h3>

<p>
  Playbills is a hosted repository of available Limelight production. When you open 
  the Limelight application, Playbills will open automatically (assuming you’re 
  connected to the internet) and display a playbill for each production. Each Playbill 
  provides a brief description to help you decide if you’d like to open the production. 
  When you’re convince, click on the provided button. The production will be downloaded 
  an opened in Limelight. Pretty nifty I think.
</p>


<h3>Limelight Docs</h3>

<p>
  Among one list is a Playbill for our own Limelight Docs production. We’re quite pleased 
  with this one. It’s a swiss army knife of documentation that should make it fairly simple 
  for developers to build their own Limelight productions. You’ll find descriptions, 
  walkthroughs, RDoc, and dynamic sandboxes where you can experiment with the features 
  right inside the documentation! What’s more, the RDoc is loaded dynamically from 
  Limelight’s runtime… You can’t get more up to date than that!
</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>
  Limelight has been a thrilling side project to work on. I’m very pleased with how it is 
  turning out. We are using Limelight internally at 8th Light for a variety of projects. 
  This release (0.5.0) is still a beta but the Framework is maturing rapidly. Although 
  there are still a few rough spots, I’d certainly be willing to use it for production 
  projects. Development on Limelight is active and the productivity advantages of using 
  Limelight are hard to beat.

  P.S. If you have a production you’d like listed on the Playbills server, let me know 
  (micah at 8thlight dot com).
