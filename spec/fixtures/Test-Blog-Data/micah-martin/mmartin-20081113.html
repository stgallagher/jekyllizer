  I’ve recorded my 
  <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2234715">Langston’s Ant kata</a> for all to see.
</p>

<p>
  This particular kata, with slight variations, has been in front of an audience 
  twice before. Once at a 
  <a href="http://groups.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship group SCG</a> 
  meeting and again at 
  <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/32">RubyConf2007</a>.
</p>

<p>
  On both occasions I asked the audience to evaluate my performance on a scale of 
  0-10, 0 being the worst kata you can imagine, and 10 being the best. At the SCG, 
  my performance was longer than the screencast because I didn’t use the 
  <code>instance_eval</code> trick and wrote multiple case/when statements. It 
  resulted in much more code as well. Honestly, I felt the kata dragged on a bit too 
  long which is why I shortened in subsequent performances. Despite this, the SCG 
  audience gave me an average score of 8. At RubyConf, the kata was almost exactly 
  like the screencast and it earned me an average score of 7.
</p>

<p>
  Now coming from an audience of dedicated Ruby developers, I’m quite pleased with 
  my score. Here’s some of the feedback I got…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use of <code>instance_eval:</code> -1</li>
  <li>First test, going from compile error to passing tests: -1</li>
  <li>Refactoring on with red bar: -1 (not repeated in the screencast)</li>
  <li>Non-idiomatic <code>is_black?:</code> -0.5 (fixed in screencast)</li>
  <li>Steps are too big in between tests: -1</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>  
  I find this feedback immensely valuable and thank those who took the time to 
  provide me with it.

  In martial arts, the techniques performed in kata are not always by the book. 
  There is an aspect of art, creativity, and entertainment. At several points in 
  my Langston’s Ant kata I intentionally decided to bend the rules to enhance 
  artistic and entertainment values. I leave it up to you whether I made the 
  right compromise or not.

  After watching the kata, leave a comment with your rating and any feedback 
  you have for me. I thank you in advanced.
