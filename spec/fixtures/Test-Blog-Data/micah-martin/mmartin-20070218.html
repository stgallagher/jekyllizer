<h1>Storing Binary Data in Postgres? Beware!</h1>

<p>If your situation matches the following conditions, beware!</p>
<ol>
	<li>You’re working in rails.</li>
	<li>You’re using Postgresql.</li>
	<li>You’re storing binary data in the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This was the situation on a project of mine. We were storing PDFs and PNG images in our 
	Postgrs database. Everything was fine during development and testing where we used files 
	that ranged up to a few dozen kilobytes in size. The situation went rapidly downhill when 
	file sizes got up in the hundreds of kilobytes to megabytes. The worst part about it was 
	that the errors we got were misleading and seemingly random. They included:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>undefined method `<<' for nil:NilClass</code></li>
	<li><code>invalid end of buffer</code></li>
	<li><code>undefined class/module Packet (Packet being a model class which was definitely defined)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
	These errors sent us on a wile goose chase. The clue that finally pointed us toward the 
	problem was the fact that it took 6 seconds to load a 4M PDF document from the database. 
	That was far too long especially considering the same document could be loaded from a file 
	instantaneously.
</p>
<p>
	Apparently, binary data stored in Postgresql’s bytea data type has to be parsed on save and load 
	to escape and unescape certain characters. Unfortunately the native C postgres gem doesn’t do the 
	parsing. It’s done in the <code>PostgreSQLAdapter.unescape_bytea</code> and 
	<code>PostgreSQLAdapter.escape_bytea</code> methods (Ruby code) of ActiveRecord and the parsing 
	is a bit too intensive for Ruby. This is where the meltdown begins. It consumes too much memory, or 
	too much processing power, or … well I don’t know exactly. But I know it breaks.
</p>
<p>
	We refactored our model such that all the binary data gets stored in flat files on disk rather 
	than in the database. After this, our Rails app came back to life. It was MUCH faster too!

	Here’s hoping that if and when you encounter this problem, Google points you to this blog entry 
	and you find it helpful.
