<h1>Paper Bullet</h1>

  Work has me visit lots of software teams around the world. This past week I 
  visited a particularly fun team. They worked in a large open work area with desk 
  space for pairing and wall space for BCV (Big Visible Charts). Anyhow, there was 
  one member in particular, I’ll call him Dan, that was notorious for his mischief. 
  Most notably, he’d start paper bullet wars.
</p>

<p>
  Paper bullet is not the term they used but that’s what I’m gonna call it. What 
  you do is tear off a piece of paper and roll it lengthwise. Then fold it fold 
  it in half so you’ve got a wedge shaped paper bullet. Then take a rubber band 
  and stretch it between your thumb and index finger. Slide the wedge onto the 
  center of the rubber band, stretch, aim, and release.

  Dan had apparently surprised everyone on the team with a paper bullet in the face 
  or neck at one point or another. They held a friendly grudge against him.

  Early in the week I was unaware of the paper bullet wars and I found it peculiar 
  that there were all these bit of paper on the floors and desks. Apparently wars were 
  taking place all week but, being the guest, no one wanted to hit me and so who ever 
  was pairing with me had immunity.
</p>  

<p>
  In the final hours of the last day they confessed at how nice they were and how 
  lucky I was that I didn’t get shot all week. Frankly I was disappointed that I didn’t 
  get to play all week so I spat out some fighting words… “You’re lucky you never got 
  me involved!”. It began. I could hear them whistle past my ears as I was writing so 
  unit tests or bounce off the wall behind me as I pass the keyboard to my pair, but I 
  never got hit.
</p>

<p>
  Thankfully, other team member armed me a rubber band and a hand full of paper bullets. 
  At a quiet moment, I figured I’ve give this game a try. Grabbing the rubber band and 
  paper wedge, I loaded and aimed right at Dan’s head. The rubber band was surprisingly 
  flexible. Not knowing how hard to stretch it, I just kept pulling. As I looked down the 
  trajectory, I was sure the projectile would curve. When I released I was shocked and 
  horrified.
</p>

<p>
  The bullet screamed across the room, straight as an arrow, pegging Dan right in the 
  side of the head. It made a loud smacking noise upon impact. The whole team heard it 
  and the room went silent. I was terrified. This was no way to treat your clients, I 
  thought. The poor guy never even hit me so he didn’t deserve it. Apparently I was wrong. 
  Everyone else thought he deserved it. The room broke out in laughter. Team members 
  (not Dan) gave me a thumbs up, telling me “Thanks” or “Good job”.
</p>  

<p>
  I apologized to Dan later, trying not to stare at the red welt just below his temple. 
  Dan, the sportsman that he is, congratulated me on my marksmanship. He’s a good guy.
</p>  

<p>
  So what’s the moral of the story? None really. But I will note that many of the development 
  environments I visit are much more sterile and “professional” than this team…. and much 
  less productive as well.
