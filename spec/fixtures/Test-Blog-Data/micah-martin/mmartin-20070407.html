<h1>Understanding Statemachines, Part 4: Superstates</h1>

<h3>Superstates</h3>
<p>
	Often in statemachines, duplication can arise. For example, the vending machine in our examples 
	may need periodic repairs. It’s not certain which state the vending machine will be in when the 
	repair man arrives. So all states should have a transition into the Repair Mode state.

Diagram 1 - Without Superstates

-->
<p>
	In this diagram, both the <code>Waiting</code> and <code>Paid</code> states have a transition to 
	the Repair Mode invoked by the repair event. Duplication! We can dry this up by using the 
	<b>Superstate</b> construct. See below:
</p>

Diagram 2 - With Superstates

-->
<p>
	Here we introduce the Operational superstate. Both the <code>Waiting</code> and <code>Paid</code> 
	states are contained within the superstate which implies that they inherit all of the superstate’s 
	transitions. That means we only need one transition into the <code>Repair Mode</code> state from the 
	<code>Operational</code> superstate to achieve the same behavior as the solution in <i>diagram 1</i>.
</p>
<p>
	One statemachine may have multiple superstates. And every superstate may contain other superstates. 
	ie. Superstates can be nested.

<h3>History State</h3>
<p>
	The solution in <i>diagram 2</i> has an advantage over <i>diagram 1</i>. In <i>diagram 1</i>1, once 
	the repair man is done he triggers the operate event and the vending machine transitions into the 
	<code>Waiting</code> event. This is unfortunate. Even if the vending machine was in the <code>Paid</code> 
	state before the repair man came along, it will be in the <code>Waiting</code> state after he leaves. 
	Shouldn’t it go back into the <code>Paid</code> state?
</p>
<p>
	Superstates come with the <b>history state</b> which solves this problem. Every superstate will 
	remember which state it is in before the superstate is exited. This memory is stored in a pseudo state 
	called the <b>history state</b>. Transitions that end in the history state will recall the last active 
	state of the superstate and enter it.
</p>
<p>
	You can see the history state being use in <i>diagram 2</i>. In this solution, the history state allows 
	the vending machine to return from a repair session into the same state it was in before, as though nothing 
	happened at all.
</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
	The following code builds the statemachine in diagram 2. Watch out for the <code>_H</code>. This is how 
	the history state is denoted. If you have a superstate named <code>foo</foo>, then it’s history state 
	will be named <code>foo_H</code>.
</p>
<!-- 
require 'rubygems'
require 'statemachine'

vending_machine = Statemachine.build do
  superstate :operational do
    trans :waiting, :dollar, :paid
    trans :paid, :selection, :waiting
    trans :waiting, :selection, :waiting
    trans :paid, :dollar, :paid

    event :repair, :repair_mode,  Proc.new { puts "Entering Repair Mode" }
  end

  trans :repair_mode, :operate, :operational_H, Proc.new { puts "Exiting Repair Mode" }

  on_entry_of :waiting, Proc.new { puts "Entering Waiting State" }
  on_entry_of :paid, Proc.new { puts "Entering Paid State" }
end

vending_machine.repair
vending_machine.operate
vending_machine.dollar
vending_machine.repair
vending_machine.operate
-->
<p>Output:</p>
<!--
Entering Repair Mode
Exiting Repair Mode
Entering Waiting State
Entering Paid State
Entering Repair Mode
Exiting Repair Mode
Entering Paid State
-->
<p>
	Next we should cover pseudo states.
