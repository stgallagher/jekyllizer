He puts it gently… We’ve actually had some heated arguments about these mocking frameworks and it’a all kinda silly. In the end we’re writting good tests for well designed code. Still, these mocking frameworks rub me the wrong way.

<h4>Why do I prefer hand-made mocks?</h4>
 
 <p>
   1 They’re simple to write. Yeah it requires a new class but it only takes a couple seconds 
   and it’s the most brainless code you’ll ever write. 2 They’re simple to use. If I want an 
   instance of a DataEntryView I simple type new MockDataEntryView(). With a mocking framework, 
   it takes 3 or 4 lines before I have a usable object. 3 They’re much more flexible. With mocking 
   frameworks you can set returns values and expected method calls but that’s about it. Hand-made 
   mocks are limited only by your imagination. 4 Mocking frameworks are refactoring-challenged. 
   Especially NMock. Rename a method and dozens of tests will break. 5 Readability. Tests using 
   hand-made mock are easy to read. Tests using mocking frameworks require murky configuration. 
   6 Mocking frameworks violate testing convention. Build, Operate, Check. Conventionally, all 
   tests follow this flow. With mocking frameworks the flow becomes, Build, Check, Operate, Verify.
   7 Failures are deceptive with mocking frameworks. When you get a failure in a test using a mocking 
   framework, the line number usually points to a call to Verify. With Rhino it can point to the last 
   line of a using block. Either way, the failure could have been caused by any number of assertions. 
   It’s up to you to figure out which one. With hand-made mocks, line numbers pinpoint the problem by 
   revealing the exact failing assertion.

<h4>What do I hope to get out of the Mockoff?</h4>

<p>
  I’ve played with several mocking frameworks before. 
  I hope that by committing to use them for 3 days, I’ll gain insight as to so many people use them. 
  Maybe I’ll find that they improve my productivity and I’ll use them in the future on a regular 
  basis.

<h4>What do I expect to happen during the Mockoff?</h4>

<p>  
  I’m trying very hard to have an open mind going 
  into this. My stubborn self is expecting 3 days of frustration. My optimistic self is expecting to 
  gain appreciation for mocking frameworks. We’ll see what happens.
