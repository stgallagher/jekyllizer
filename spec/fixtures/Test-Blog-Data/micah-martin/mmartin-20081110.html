  You remember the classic Simon game, right? The one where the electronic 
  devise will blink a color and make a sound that you have to replicate by 
  pushing the colored buttons.

  At RubyConf 2008, I cornered 
  <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> 
  and asked his opinion on Limelight. He didn’t feel like he had seen enough 
  of it to give a good opinion. So we found an hour where we could both sit down 
  and build a simple Limelight production. We decided to build Simon.
</p>  

<p>
  The result is really quite simple. It’s a couple hundred lines of code, UI, 
  game logic, and all. It’s also got a suite of unit tests.

  If 
  <a href="http://limelight.8thlight.com/main/download">Limelight is installed</a>
  , you can download the production file, and double 
  click it, or enter the url in the Startup Limelight Production.
