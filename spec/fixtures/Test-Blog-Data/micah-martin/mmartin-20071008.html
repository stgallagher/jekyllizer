<h1>Micah's General Guidelines on Ruby require</h1>

<p>
	Ruby files have to require other files. There’s not avoiding it. Techniques to manage require 
	statements are numerous and varied. Having tried most of them, I’ve found a system that works 
	well for me. What follows are the guidelines I use to manage Ruby require statements.
</p>
<h3>1. Establish a Convenient Search Path</h3>
<p>
	Although it’s possible to use absolute paths or complex relative paths such as below,
</p>	
<!-- 
require "/Users/micahmartin/Projects/ttt/lib/game"
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "../../../lib/ai/winner" 
-->
<p>
	this should be avoided as much as possible. Otherwise you’ll be fixing dozens of require statements 
	every time you move a file. It’s no fun. You’ll want your <code>require</code>s to look like this:
</p>
<!-- 
require "game"
require "ai/winner" 
-->
<p>
	To achieve this, add your lib directory to the ruby search path.
</p>
<p>
	$: << File.expand_path(File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>) + “/../lib”))
</p>
<p>
	This will have to go in one of the first files that gets loaded. If you’ve got a standalone 
	Ruby app, you could add this to the startup script. In a Rails app, it can go in environment.rb. 
	If you’re using RSpec, you may want to add it to spec_helper.rb.
</p>
<h3>2. Independent Requiring over Require Farms</h3>
<p>
	In some projects, you’ll find files that contain nothing but <code>require</code> statements. 
	It’s common in gem projects. The advantage is that users of the library need only require one 
	file which in turn requires everything else you’ll need. Convenient huh? Sure is. But there are 
	2 major consequences of this:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><i>Maintenance Mayhem</i> - Every time you add, delete, or rename a file you have to remember 
		to update the require farm file. It’s easy to forget. And the order of requires can get very 
		hard to manage especially if you end up with cyclic dependancies.
	</li>
	<li><i>Drowning in Dependancies</i> - Require Farms have a tendency to require more than you want. 
		If there’s only a portion of the library you’d like to use, with the Require Farm you get the whole 
		thing. The extra dependancies will consume more memory at run time and they may add undesired behavior 
		to your system. In general, this is a violation of the 
		<a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf">Dependancy Inversion Principle</a>.
	</li>
</ol>		
<p>
	Rather than build Require Farms, allow each file to be responsible for it’s own dependancies. Let 
	each file require the files it needs to work. This approach can be a bit annoying as you’ll find 
	your self using altogether more require statements, but it’ll pay off in the long run. With each 
	file independently managing it’s dependancies, the system will be easier to maintain and it’s 
	components more reusable.
</p>
<h3>3. Building Absolute Paths</h3>
<p>
	Try as you may, you can’t always avoid using absolute file paths in your require statements. The 
	following is reliable way to refer to other files.
</p>
<!-- 
File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), "..", "spec_helper")
-->
<p>Let me break it down. First:</p>
<!-- 
File.dirname(__FILE__)
--> 
<p>
	This gives you the directory of the current file that is being executed. However, you never know 
	what you’re gonna get since the form of the path is based on how the program was executed. This 
	might give you an absolute path or it might give you a relative path from anywhere on the system. 
	In some cases, Ruby won’t do what you expect with relative paths so it’s best to expand this into 
	an absolute path.
</p>
<!-- 
File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) 
-->
<p>
	Now you’ve got an absolute file path and you just have to add a relative path to the desired 
	file. Normally I’d do this:
</p>
<!-- 
File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "../spec_helper") 
-->
<p>
	However, this is not quite portable since I’m using forward slashes. To get this to work on any system 
	independent of file separator, use <code>File.join</code> as shown above. Use this technique to require 
	files when you don’t have your search path configured.
</p>
