<p>
	<strong>1. You find your self delivering software to your customer who says “That’s not what I asked for.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Using 
	<a href="http://fitnesse.org/">FitNesse</a> allows you to communicate with the customer up front. Before a line of 
	code is written, you can have all the behavior expressed in an executable format. Make sure the customer helps to 
	write these tests. Once your FitNesse test is in place, all you need to do it make it pass. Due to the cut-and-dry 
	aspect of executable specifications (FitNesse test), one the spec is passing, you have delivered precisely what your 
	customer asked for.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2. Bugs sneak into your system as development progresses and these bugs takes weeks to find and remove.</strong>
</p>	

<p>
	FitNesse is a tools to help you drive development with tests. When practices with discipline, test driven 
	development will insure that you have a FitNesse test for each and every feature in your system. The moment 
	a bug is introduced, you will know about it because a FitNesse test will fail.
</p>	

<p>
	<strong>3. It is difficult to create documentation for your system and it is constantly out of date because 
		the system is changing.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	FitNesse offers a unique documentation solution. When ever you write a FitNesse test, you are in fact describing 
	how the system works. In other words you’re documenting it. The web/wiki based nature of FitNesse makes documentation 
	simple and convenient. The best part is that the documentation in FitNesse can never go out of date. Since you’re 
	keeping your test passing, and your tests are documentation, it’s impossible for them to lie.

	There is an article I wrote about FitNesse for 
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Developer-Power-Tools-Turbocharge/dp/0596527543/sr=8-1/qid=1169220593
	/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9322374-5606501?ie=UTF8&s=books">Windows Developer Power Tools</a>. 
	This book, just released today, includes articles on dozens of free tools that .NET developers might benefit 
	from. If you write .NET code, check it out. If not, keep in mind that FitNesse will work for almost any language.
